<h2><a id=DESCRIPTION href=#DESCRIPTION></a>DESCRIPTION &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=#top_of_page><span class=top-link>top</span></a></h2><pre>       The <b>proc </b>filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an
       interface to kernel data structures.  It is commonly mounted at
       <i>/proc</i>.  Typically, it is mounted automatically by the system, but
       it can also be mounted manually using a command such as:

           mount -t proc proc /proc

       Most of the files in the <b>proc </b>filesystem are read-only, but some
       files are writable, allowing kernel variables to be changed.

   <b>Mount options</b>
       The <b>proc </b>filesystem supports the following mount options:

       <b>hidepid</b>=<i>n</i> (since Linux 3.3)
              This option controls who can access the information in
              <i>/proc/</i>pid directories.  The argument, <i>n</i>, is one of the
              following values:

              0   Everybody may access all <i>/proc/</i>pid directories.  This
                  is the traditional behavior, and the default if this
                  mount option is not specified.

              1   Users may not access files and subdirectories inside
                  any <i>/proc/</i>pid directories but their own (the <i>/proc/</i>pid
                  directories themselves remain visible).  Sensitive
                  files such as <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cmdline</i> and <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/status</i>
                  are now protected against other users.  This makes it
                  impossible to learn whether any user is running a
                  specific program (so long as the program doesn't
                  otherwise reveal itself by its behavior).

              2   As for mode 1, but in addition the <i>/proc/</i>pid
                  directories belonging to other users become invisible.
                  This means that <i>/proc/</i>pid entries can no longer be
                  used to discover the PIDs on the system.  This doesn't
                  hide the fact that a process with a specific PID value
                  exists (it can be learned by other means, for example,
                  by "kill -0 $PID"), but it hides a process's UID and
                  GID, which could otherwise be learned by employing
                  <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html>stat(2)</a> on a <i>/proc/</i>pid directory.  This greatly
                  complicates an attacker's task of gathering
                  information about running processes (e.g., discovering
                  whether some daemon is running with elevated
                  privileges, whether another user is running some
                  sensitive program, whether other users are running any
                  program at all, and so on).

       <b>gid</b>=<i>gid</i> (since Linux 3.3)
              Specifies the ID of a group whose members are authorized
              to learn process information otherwise prohibited by
              <b>hidepid </b>(i.e., users in this group behave as though <i>/proc</i>
              was mounted with <i>hidepid=0</i>).  This group should be used
              instead of approaches such as putting nonroot users into
              the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sudoers.5.html>sudoers(5)</a> file.

   <b>Overview</b>
       Underneath <i>/proc</i>, there are the following general groups of files
       and subdirectories:

       <i>/proc/</i>pid subdirectories
              Each one of these subdirectories contains files and
              subdirectories exposing information about the process with
              the corresponding process ID.

              Underneath each of the <i>/proc/</i>pid directories, a <i>task</i>
              subdirectory contains subdirectories of the form <i>task/</i>tid,
              which contain corresponding information about each of the
              threads in the process, where <i>tid</i> is the kernel thread ID
              of the thread.

              The <i>/proc/</i>pid subdirectories are visible when iterating
              through <i>/proc</i> with <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html>getdents(2)</a> (and thus are visible when
              one uses <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html>ls(1)</a> to view the contents of <i>/proc</i>).

       <i>/proc/</i>tid subdirectories
              Each one of these subdirectories contains files and
              subdirectories exposing information about the thread with
              the corresponding thread ID.  The contents of these
              directories are the same as the corresponding
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task/</i>tid directories.

              The <i>/proc/</i>tid subdirectories are <i>not</i> visible when
              iterating through <i>/proc</i> with <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html>getdents(2)</a> (and thus are <i>not</i>
              visible when one uses <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html>ls(1)</a> to view the contents of
              <i>/proc</i>).

       <i>/proc/self</i>
              When a process accesses this magic symbolic link, it
              resolves to the process's own <i>/proc/</i>pid directory.

       <i>/proc/thread-self</i>
              When a thread accesses this magic symbolic link, it
              resolves to the process's own <i>/proc/self/task/</i>tid
              directory.

       <i>/proc/[a-z]*</i>
              Various other files and subdirectories under <i>/proc</i> expose
              system-wide information.

       All of the above are described in more detail below.

   <b>Files and directories</b>
       The following list provides details of many of the files and
       directories under the <i>/proc</i> hierarchy.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid
              There is a numerical subdirectory for each running
              process; the subdirectory is named by the process ID.
              Each <i>/proc/</i>pid subdirectory contains the pseudo-files and
              directories described below.

              The files inside each <i>/proc/</i>pid directory are normally
              owned by the effective user and effective group ID of the
              process.  However, as a security measure, the ownership is
              made <i>root:root</i> if the process's "dumpable" attribute is
              set to a value other than 1.

              Before Linux 4.11, <i>root:root</i> meant the "global" root user
              ID and group ID (i.e., UID 0 and GID 0 in the initial user
              namespace).  Since Linux 4.11, if the process is in a
              noninitial user namespace that has a valid mapping for
              user (group) ID 0 inside the namespace, then the user
              (group) ownership of the files under <i>/proc/</i>pid is instead
              made the same as the root user (group) ID of the
              namespace.  This means that inside a container, things
              work as expected for the container "root" user.

              The process's "dumpable" attribute may change for the
              following reasons:

              •  The attribute was explicitly set via the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a>
                 <b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE </b>operation.

              •  The attribute was reset to the value in the file
                 <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> (described below), for the
                 reasons described in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a>.

              Resetting the "dumpable" attribute to 1 reverts the
              ownership of the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/*</i> files to the process's
              effective UID and GID.  Note, however, that if the
              effective UID or GID is subsequently modified, then the
              "dumpable" attribute may be reset, as described in
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a>.  Therefore, it may be desirable to reset the
              "dumpable" attribute <i>after</i> making any desired changes to
              the process's effective UID or GID.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr</i>
              The files in this directory provide an API for security
              modules.  The contents of this directory are files that
              can be read and written in order to set security-related
              attributes.  This directory was added to support SELinux,
              but the intention was that the API be general enough to
              support other security modules.  For the purpose of
              explanation, examples of how SELinux uses these files are
              provided below.

              This directory is present only if the kernel was
              configured with <b>CONFIG_SECURITY</b>.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/current</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              The contents of this file represent the current security
              attributes of the process.

              In SELinux, this file is used to get the security context
              of a process.  Prior to Linux 2.6.11, this file could not
              be used to set the security context (a write was always
              denied), since SELinux limited process security
              transitions to <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a> (see the description of
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/exec</i>, below).  Since Linux 2.6.11, SELinux
              lifted this restriction and began supporting "set"
              operations via writes to this node if authorized by
              policy, although use of this operation is only suitable
              for applications that are trusted to maintain any desired
              separation between the old and new security contexts.

              Prior to Linux 2.6.28, SELinux did not allow threads
              within a multithreaded process to set their security
              context via this node as it would yield an inconsistency
              among the security contexts of the threads sharing the
              same memory space.  Since Linux 2.6.28, SELinux lifted
              this restriction and began supporting "set" operations for
              threads within a multithreaded process if the new security
              context is bounded by the old security context, where the
              bounded relation is defined in policy and guarantees that
              the new security context has a subset of the permissions
              of the old security context.

              Other security modules may choose to support "set"
              operations via writes to this node.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/exec</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file represents the attributes to assign to the
              process upon a subsequent <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a>.

              In SELinux, this is needed to support role/domain
              transitions, and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a> is the preferred point to make
              such transitions because it offers better control over the
              initialization of the process in the new security label
              and the inheritance of state.  In SELinux, this attribute
              is reset on <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a> so that the new program reverts to
              the default behavior for any <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a> calls that it may
              make.  In SELinux, a process can set only its own
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/exec</i> attribute.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/fscreate</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file represents the attributes to assign to files
              created by subsequent calls to <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html>open(2)</a>, <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mkdir.2.html>mkdir(2)</a>,
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/symlink.2.html>symlink(2)</a>, and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mknod.2.html>mknod(2)</a>

              SELinux employs this file to support creation of a file
              (using the aforementioned system calls) in a secure state,
              so that there is no risk of inappropriate access being
              obtained between the time of creation and the time that
              attributes are set.  In SELinux, this attribute is reset
              on <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a>, so that the new program reverts to the
              default behavior for any file creation calls it may make,
              but the attribute will persist across multiple file
              creation calls within a program unless it is explicitly
              reset.  In SELinux, a process can set only its own
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/fscreate</i> attribute.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/keycreate</i> (since Linux 2.6.18)
              If a process writes a security context into this file, all
              subsequently created keys (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/add_key.2.html>add_key(2)</a>) will be labeled
              with this context.  For further information, see the
              kernel source file <i>Documentation/security/keys/core.rst</i>
              (or file <i>Documentation/security/keys.txt</i> between Linux 3.0
              and Linux 4.13, or <i>Documentation/keys.txt</i> before Linux
              3.0).

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/prev</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file contains the security context of the process
              before the last <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a>; that is, the previous value of
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/current</i>.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/attr/socketcreate</i> (since Linux 2.6.18)
              If a process writes a security context into this file, all
              subsequently created sockets will be labeled with this
              context.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/autogroup</i> (since Linux 2.6.38)
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sched.7.html>sched(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/auxv</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This contains the contents of the ELF interpreter
              information passed to the process at exec time.  The
              format is one <i>unsigned long</i> ID plus one <i>unsigned long</i>
              value for each entry.  The last entry contains two zeros.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/clear_refs</i> (since Linux 2.6.22)

              This is a write-only file, writable only by owner of the
              process.

              The following values may be written to the file:

              1 (since Linux 2.6.22)
                     Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for
                     all the pages associated with the process.  (Before
                     Linux 2.6.32, writing any nonzero value to this
                     file had this effect.)

              2 (since Linux 2.6.32)
                     Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for
                     all anonymous pages associated with the process.

              3 (since Linux 2.6.32)
                     Reset the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits for
                     all file-mapped pages associated with the process.

              Clearing the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits
              provides a method to measure approximately how much memory
              a process is using.  One first inspects the values in the
              "Referenced" fields for the VMAs shown in <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/smaps</i>
              to get an idea of the memory footprint of the process.
              One then clears the PG_Referenced and ACCESSED/YOUNG bits
              and, after some measured time interval, once again
              inspects the values in the "Referenced" fields to get an
              idea of the change in memory footprint of the process
              during the measured interval.  If one is interested only
              in inspecting the selected mapping types, then the value 2
              or 3 can be used instead of 1.

              Further values can be written to affect different
              properties:

              4 (since Linux 3.11)
                     Clear the soft-dirty bit for all the pages
                     associated with the process.  This is used (in
                     conjunction with <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/pagemap</i>) by the check-
                     point restore system to discover which pages of a
                     process have been dirtied since the file
                     <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/clear_refs</i> was written to.

              5 (since Linux 4.0)
                     Reset the peak resident set size ("high water
                     mark") to the process's current resident set size
                     value.

              Writing any value to <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/clear_refs</i> other than those
              listed above has no effect.

              The <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/clear_refs</i> file is present only if the
              <b>CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR </b>kernel configuration option is
              enabled.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cmdline</i>
              This read-only file holds the complete command line for
              the process, unless the process is a zombie.  In the
              latter case, there is nothing in this file: that is, a
              read on this file will return 0 characters.

              For processes which are still running, the command-line
              arguments appear in this file in the same layout as they
              do in process memory: If the process is well-behaved, it
              is a set of strings separated by null bytes ('\0'), with a
              further null byte after the last string.

              This is the common case, but processes have the freedom to
              override the memory region and break assumptions about the
              contents or format of the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cmdline</i> file.

              If, after an <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a>, the process modifies its <i>argv</i>
              strings, those changes will show up here.  This is not the
              same thing as modifying the <i>argv</i> array.

              Furthermore, a process may change the memory location that
              this file refers via <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a> operations such as
              <b>PR_SET_MM_ARG_START</b>.

              Think of this file as the command line that the process
              wants you to see.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/comm</i> (since Linux 2.6.33)
              This file exposes the process's <i>comm</i> value—that is, the
              command name associated with the process.  Different
              threads in the same process may have different <i>comm</i>
              values, accessible via <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task/</i>tid<i>/comm</i>.  A thread
              may modify its <i>comm</i> value, or that of any of other thread
              in the same thread group (see the discussion of
              <b>CLONE_THREAD </b>in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html>clone(2)</a>), by writing to the file
              <i>/proc/self/task/</i>tid<i>/comm</i>.  Strings longer than
              <b>TASK_COMM_LEN </b>(16) characters (including the terminating
              null byte) are silently truncated.

              This file provides a superset of the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_NAME</b>
              and <b>PR_GET_NAME </b>operations, and is employed by

              than the caller.  The value in this file is used for the

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cwd</i>
              This is a symbolic link to the current working directory
              of the process.  To find out the current working directory
              of process 20, for instance, you can do this:

                  $ <b>cd /proc/20/cwd; pwd -P</b>

              In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic
              link are not available if the main thread has already
              terminated (typically by calling <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_exit.3.html>pthread_exit(3)</a>).

              Permission to dereference or read (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readlink.2.html>readlink(2)</a>) this
              symbolic link is governed by a ptrace access mode
              <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS </b>check; see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html>ptrace(2)</a>.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/environ</i>
              This file contains the initial environment that was set
              when the currently executing program was started via
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a>.  The entries are separated by null bytes
              ('\0'), and there may be a null byte at the end.  Thus, to
              print out the environment of process 1, you would do:

                  $ <b>cat /proc/1/environ | tr '\000' '\n'</b>

              If, after an <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a>, the process modifies its
              environment (e.g., by calling functions such as <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/putenv.3.html>putenv(3)</a>
              or modifying the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/environ.7.html>environ(7)</a> variable directly), this file
              will <i>not</i> reflect those changes.

              Furthermore, a process may change the memory location that
              this file refers via <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a> operations such as

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/exe</i>
              Under Linux 2.2 and later, this file is a symbolic link
              containing the actual pathname of the executed command.
              This symbolic link can be dereferenced normally;
              attempting to open it will open the executable.  You can
              even type <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/exe</i> to run another copy of the same
              executable that is being run by process <i>pid</i>.  If the
              pathname has been unlinked, the symbolic link will contain
              the string ' (deleted)' appended to the original pathname.
              In a multithreaded process, the contents of this symbolic
              link are not available if the main thread has already
              terminated (typically by calling <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_exit.3.html>pthread_exit(3)</a>).

              Permission to dereference or read (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readlink.2.html>readlink(2)</a>) this
              symbolic link is governed by a ptrace access mode
              <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS </b>check; see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html>ptrace(2)</a>.

              Under Linux 2.0 and earlier, <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/exe</i> is a pointer to
              the binary which was executed, and appears as a symbolic
              link.  A <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readlink.2.html>readlink(2)</a> call on this file under Linux 2.0
              returns a string in the format:

                  [device]:inode

              For example, [0301]:1502 would be inode 1502 on device
              major 03 (IDE, MFM, etc. drives) minor 01 (first partition
              on the first drive).

              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html>find(1)</a> with the <i>-inum</i> option can be used to locate the
              file.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd/</i>
              This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file
              which the process has open, named by its file descriptor,
              and which is a symbolic link to the actual file.  Thus, 0
              is standard input, 1 standard output, 2 standard error,
              and so on.

              For file descriptors for pipes and sockets, the entries
              will be symbolic links whose content is the file type with
              the inode.  A <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readlink.2.html>readlink(2)</a> call on this file returns a
              string in the format:

                  type:[inode]

              For example, <i>socket:[2248868]</i> will be a socket and its
              inode is 2248868.  For sockets, that inode can be used to
              find more information in one of the files under
              <i>/proc/net/</i>.

              For file descriptors that have no corresponding inode
              (e.g., file descriptors produced by <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/bpf.2.html>bpf(2)</a>,
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_create.2.html>epoll_create(2)</a>, <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/eventfd.2.html>eventfd(2)</a>, <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/inotify_init.2.html>inotify_init(2)</a>,
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/perf_event_open.2.html>perf_event_open(2)</a>, <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/signalfd.2.html>signalfd(2)</a>, <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_create.2.html>timerfd_create(2)</a>, and
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html>userfaultfd(2)</a>), the entry will be a symbolic link with
              contents of the form

                  anon_inode:<i>file-type</i>

              In many cases (but not all), the <i>file-type</i> is surrounded
              by square brackets.

              For example, an epoll file descriptor will have a symbolic
              link whose content is the string <i>anon_inode:[eventpoll]</i>.

              In a multithreaded process, the contents of this directory
              are not available if the main thread has already
              terminated (typically by calling <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_exit.3.html>pthread_exit(3)</a>).

              Programs that take a filename as a command-line argument,
              but don't take input from standard input if no argument is
              supplied, and programs that write to a file named as a
              command-line argument, but don't send their output to
              standard output if no argument is supplied, can
              nevertheless be made to use standard input or standard
              output by using <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd</i> files as command-line
              arguments.  For example, assuming that <i>-i</i> is the flag
              designating an input file and <i>-o</i> is the flag designating
              an output file:

                  $ <b>foobar -i /proc/self/fd/0 -o /proc/self/fd/1 ...</b>

              and you have a working filter.

              <i>/proc/self/fd/N</i> is approximately the same as <i>/dev/fd/N</i> in
              some UNIX and UNIX-like systems.  Most Linux MAKEDEV
              scripts symbolically link <i>/dev/fd</i> to <i>/proc/self/fd</i>, in
              fact.

              Most systems provide symbolic links <i>/dev/stdin</i>,
              <i>/dev/stdout</i>, and <i>/dev/stderr</i>, which respectively link to
              the files <i>0</i>, <i>1</i>, and <i>2</i> in <i>/proc/self/fd</i>.  Thus the example
              command above could be written as:

                  $ <b>foobar -i /dev/stdin -o /dev/stdout ...</b>

              Permission to dereference or read (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readlink.2.html>readlink(2)</a>) the
              symbolic links in this directory is governed by a ptrace
              access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS </b>check; see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html>ptrace(2)</a>.

              Note that for file descriptors referring to inodes (pipes
              and sockets, see above), those inodes still have
              permission bits and ownership information distinct from
              those of the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fd</i> entry, and that the owner may
              differ from the user and group IDs of the process.  An
              unprivileged process may lack permissions to open them, as
              in this example:

                  $ <b>echo test | sudo -u nobody cat</b>
                  test
                  $ <b>echo test | sudo -u nobody cat /proc/self/fd/0</b>
                  cat: /proc/self/fd/0: Permission denied

              File descriptor 0 refers to the pipe created by the shell
              and owned by that shell's user, which is not <i>nobody</i>, so
              <b>cat </b>does not have permission to create a new file
              descriptor to read from that inode, even though it can
              still read from its existing file descriptor 0.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/fdinfo/</i> (since Linux 2.6.22)
              This is a subdirectory containing one entry for each file
              which the process has open, named by its file descriptor.
              The files in this directory are readable only by the owner
              of the process.  The contents of each file can be read to
              obtain information about the corresponding file
              descriptor.  The content depends on the type of file
              referred to by the corresponding file descriptor.

              For regular files and directories, we see something like:

                  $ <b>cat /proc/12015/fdinfo/4</b>
                  pos:    1000
                  flags:  01002002
                  mnt_id: 21

              The fields are as follows:

              <i>pos</i>    This is a decimal number showing the file offset.

              <i>flags</i>  This is an octal number that displays the file
                     access mode and file status flags (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html>open(2)</a>).
                     If the close-on-exec file descriptor flag is set,
                     then <i>flags</i> will also include the value <b>O_CLOEXEC</b>.

                     Before Linux 3.1, this field incorrectly displayed
                     the setting of <b>O_CLOEXEC </b>at the time the file was
                     opened, rather than the current setting of the
                     close-on-exec flag.

              <i>mnt_id</i> This field, present since Linux 3.15, is the ID of
                     the mount containing this file.  See the
                     description of <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mountinfo</i>.

              For eventfd file descriptors (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/eventfd.2.html>eventfd(2)</a>), we see
              (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:

                  pos: 0

                  eventfd-count:               40

              <i>eventfd-count</i> is the current value of the eventfd counter,
              in hexadecimal.

              For epoll file descriptors (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html>epoll(7)</a>), we see (since
              Linux 3.8) the following fields:

                  pos: 0
                  flags:    02
                  mnt_id:   10
                  tfd:        9 events:       19 data: 74253d2500000009
                  tfd:        7 events:       19 data: 74253d2500000007

              Each of the lines beginning <i>tfd</i> describes one of the file
              descriptors being monitored via the epoll file descriptor
              (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_ctl.2.html>epoll_ctl(2)</a> for some details).  The <i>tfd</i> field is the
              number of the file descriptor.  The <i>events</i> field is a
              hexadecimal mask of the events being monitored for this
              file descriptor.  The <i>data</i> field is the data value
              associated with this file descriptor.

              For signalfd file descriptors (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/signalfd.2.html>signalfd(2)</a>), we see
              (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:

                  pos: 0
                  flags:    02
                  mnt_id:   10
                  sigmask:  0000000000000006

              <i>sigmask</i> is the hexadecimal mask of signals that are
              accepted via this signalfd file descriptor.  (In this
              example, bits 2 and 3 are set, corresponding to the
              signals <b>SIGINT </b>and <b>SIGQUIT</b>; see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html>signal(7)</a>.)

              For inotify file descriptors (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html>inotify(7)</a>), we see
              (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:

                  pos: 0
                  flags:    00
                  mnt_id:   11
                  inotify wd:2 ino:7ef82a sdev:800001 mask:800afff ignored_mask:0 fhandle-bytes:8 fhandle-type:1 f_handle:2af87e00220ffd73
                  inotify wd:1 ino:192627 sdev:800001 mask:800afff ignored_mask:0 fhandle-bytes:8 fhandle-type:1 f_handle:27261900802dfd73

              Each of the lines beginning with "inotify" displays
              information about one file or directory that is being
              monitored.  The fields in this line are as follows:

              <i>wd</i>     A watch descriptor number (in decimal).

              <i>ino</i>    The inode number of the target file (in
                     hexadecimal).

              <i>sdev</i>   The ID of the device where the target file resides
                     (in hexadecimal).

              <i>mask</i>   The mask of events being monitored for the target
                     file (in hexadecimal).

              If the kernel was built with exportfs support, the path to
              the target file is exposed as a file handle, via three
              hexadecimal fields: <i>fhandle-bytes</i>, <i>fhandle-type</i>, and
              <i>f_handle</i>.

              For fanotify file descriptors (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/fanotify.7.html>fanotify(7)</a>), we see
              (since Linux 3.8) the following fields:

                  pos: 0
                  flags:    02
                  mnt_id:   11
                  fanotify flags:0 event-flags:88002
                  fanotify ino:19264f sdev:800001 mflags:0 mask:1 ignored_mask:0 fhandle-bytes:8 fhandle-type:1 f_handle:4f261900a82dfd73

              The fourth line displays information defined when the
              fanotify group was created via <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html>fanotify_init(2)</a>:

              <i>flags</i>  The <i>flags</i> argument given to <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html>fanotify_init(2)</a>
                     (expressed in hexadecimal).

              <i>event-flags</i>
                     The <i>event_f_flags</i> argument given to
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_init.2.html>fanotify_init(2)</a> (expressed in hexadecimal).

              Each additional line shown in the file contains
              information about one of the marks in the fanotify group.
              Most of these fields are as for inotify, except:

              <i>mflags</i> The flags associated with the mark (expressed in
                     hexadecimal).

              <i>mask</i>   The events mask for this mark (expressed in
                     hexadecimal).

              <i>ignored_mask</i>
                     The mask of events that are ignored for this mark
                     (expressed in hexadecimal).

              For details on these fields, see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fanotify_mark.2.html>fanotify_mark(2)</a>.

              For timerfd file descriptors (see <b>timerfd</b>(2)), we see
              (since Linux 3.17) the following fields:

                  pos:    0
                  flags:  02004002
                  mnt_id: 13
                  clockid: 0
                  ticks: 0
                  settime flags: 03
                  it_value: (7695568592, 640020877)
                  it_interval: (0, 0)

              <i>clockid</i>
                     This is the numeric value of the clock ID
                     (corresponding to one of the <b>CLOCK_* </b>constants
                     defined via <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>) that is used to mark the
                     progress of the timer (in this example, 0 is
                     <b>CLOCK_REALTIME</b>).

              <i>ticks</i>  This is the number of timer expirations that have
                     occurred, (i.e., the value that <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html>read(2)</a> on it would
                     return).

              <i>settime flags</i>
                     This field lists the flags with which the timerfd
                     was last armed (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_settime.2.html>timerfd_settime(2)</a>), in octal
                     (in this example, both <b>TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME </b>and
                     <b>TFD_TIMER_CANCEL_ON_SET </b>are set).

              <i>it_value</i>
                     This field contains the amount of time until the
                     timer will next expire, expressed in seconds and
                     nanoseconds.  This is always expressed as a
                     relative value, regardless of whether the timer was
                     created using the <b>TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME </b>flag.

              <i>it_interval</i>
                     This field contains the interval of the timer, in
                     seconds and nanoseconds.  (The <i>it_value</i> and
                     <i>it_interval</i> fields contain the values that
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_gettime.2.html>timerfd_gettime(2)</a> on this file descriptor would
                     return.)

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/gid_map</i> (since Linux 3.5)
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html>user_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/io</i> (since Linux 2.6.20)
              This file contains I/O statistics for the process, for
              example:

                  # <b>cat /proc/3828/io</b>
                  rchar: 323934931
                  wchar: 323929600
                  syscr: 632687
                  syscw: 632675
                  read_bytes: 0
                  write_bytes: 323932160
                  cancelled_write_bytes: 0

              The fields are as follows:

              <i>rchar</i>: characters read
                     The number of bytes which this task has caused to
                     be read from storage.  This is simply the sum of
                     bytes which this process passed to <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html>read(2)</a> and
                     similar system calls.  It includes things such as
                     terminal I/O and is unaffected by whether or not
                     actual physical disk I/O was required (the read
                     might have been satisfied from pagecache).

              <i>wchar</i>: characters written
                     The number of bytes which this task has caused, or
                     shall cause to be written to disk.  Similar caveats
                     apply here as with <i>rchar</i>.

              <i>syscr</i>: read syscalls
                     Attempt to count the number of read I/O operations—
                     that is, system calls such as <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html>read(2)</a> and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pread.2.html>pread(2)</a>.

              <i>syscw</i>: write syscalls
                     Attempt to count the number of write I/O
                     operations—that is, system calls such as <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html>write(2)</a>
                     and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pwrite.2.html>pwrite(2)</a>.

              <i>read_bytes</i>: bytes read
                     Attempt to count the number of bytes which this
                     process really did cause to be fetched from the
                     storage layer.  This is accurate for block-backed
                     filesystems.

              <i>write_bytes</i>: bytes written
                     Attempt to count the number of bytes which this
                     process caused to be sent to the storage layer.

              <i>cancelled_write_bytes</i>:
                     The big inaccuracy here is truncate.  If a process
                     writes 1 MB to a file and then deletes the file, it
                     will in fact perform no writeout.  But it will have
                     been accounted as having caused 1 MB of write.  In
                     other words: this field represents the number of
                     bytes which this process caused to not happen, by
                     truncating pagecache.  A task can cause "negative"
                     I/O too.  If this task truncates some dirty
                     pagecache, some I/O which another task has been
                     accounted for (in its <i>write_bytes</i>) will not be
                     happening.

              <i>Note</i>: In the current implementation, things are a bit racy
              on 32-bit systems: if process A reads process B's
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/io</i> while process B is updating one of these
              64-bit counters, process A could see an intermediate
              result.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/limits</i> (since Linux 2.6.24)
              This file displays the soft limit, hard limit, and units
              of measurement for each of the process's resource limits
              (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html>getrlimit(2)</a>).  Up to and including Linux 2.6.35,
              this file is protected to allow reading only by the real
              UID of the process.  Since Linux 2.6.36, this file is
              readable by all users on the system.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/map_files/</i> (since Linux 3.3)
              This subdirectory contains entries corresponding to
              memory-mapped files (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>mmap(2)</a>).  Entries are named by
              memory region start and end address pair (expressed as
              hexadecimal numbers), and are symbolic links to the mapped
              files themselves.  Here is an example, with the output
              wrapped and reformatted to fit on an 80-column display:

                  # <b>ls -l /proc/self/map_files/</b>
                  lr--------. 1 root root 64 Apr 16 21:31

                  ...

              Although these entries are present for memory regions that
              were mapped with the <b>MAP_FILE </b>flag, the way anonymous
              shared memory (regions created with the <b>MAP_ANON |</b>
              <b>MAP_SHARED </b>flags) is implemented in Linux means that such
              regions also appear on this directory.  Here is an example
              where the target file is the deleted <i>/dev/zero</i> one:

                  lrw-------. 1 root root 64 Apr 16 21:33
                              7fc075d2f000-7fc075e6f000 -&gt; /dev/zero (deleted)

              Until Linux 4.3, this directory appeared only if the
              <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE </b>kernel configuration option was
              enabled.

              Capabilities are required to read the contents of the
              symbolic links in this directory: before Linux 5.9, the
              reading process requires <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>in the initial user
              namespace; since Linux 5.9, the reading process must have
              either <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>or <b>CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE </b>in the
              initial (i.e. root) user namespace.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/maps</i>
              A file containing the currently mapped memory regions and
              their access permissions.  See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>mmap(2)</a> for some further
              information about memory mappings.

              The <i>address</i> field is the address space in the process that
              the mapping occupies.  The <i>perms</i> field is a set of
              permissions:

                  r = read
                  w = write
                  x = execute
                  s = shared
                  p = private (copy on write)

              The <i>offset</i> field is the offset into the file/whatever; <i>dev</i>
              is the device (major:minor); <i>inode</i> is the inode on that
              device.  0 indicates that no inode is associated with the
              memory region, as would be the case with BSS
              (uninitialized data).

              The <i>pathname</i> field will usually be the file that is
              backing the mapping.  For ELF files, you can easily
              coordinate with the <i>offset</i> field by looking at the Offset
              field in the ELF program headers (<i>readelf -l</i>).

              There are additional helpful pseudo-paths:

              <i>[stack]</i>
                     The initial process's (also known as the main
                     thread's) stack.

              <i>[stack:</i>tid<i>]</i> (from Linux 3.4 to Linux 4.4)
                     A thread's stack (where the <i>tid</i> is a thread ID).
                     It corresponds to the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task/</i>tid<i>/</i> path.
                     This field was removed in Linux 4.5, since
                     providing this information for a process with large
                     numbers of threads is expensive.

              <i>[vdso]</i> The virtual dynamically linked shared object.  See
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html>vdso(7)</a>.

              <i>[heap]</i> The process's heap.

              <i>[anon:</i>name<i>]</i> (since Linux 5.17)
                     A named private anonymous mapping.  Set with
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_VMA_ANON_NAME</b>.

              <i>[anon_shmem:</i>name<i>]</i> (since Linux 6.2)
                     A named shared anonymous mapping.  Set with
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_SET_VMA_ANON_NAME</b>.

              If the <i>pathname</i> field is blank, this is an anonymous
              mapping as obtained via <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>mmap(2)</a>.  There is no easy way to
              coordinate this back to a process's source, short of
              running it through <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gdb.1.html>gdb(1)</a>, <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html>strace(1)</a>, or similar.

              <i>pathname</i> is shown unescaped except for newline characters,
              which are replaced with an octal escape sequence.  As a
              result, it is not possible to determine whether the
              original pathname contained a newline character or the
              literal <i>\012</i> character sequence.

              If the mapping is file-backed and the file has been
              deleted, the string " (deleted)" is appended to the
              pathname.  Note that this is ambiguous too.

              Under Linux 2.0, there is no field giving pathname.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mountinfo</i> (since Linux 2.6.26)
              This file contains information about mounts in the
              process's mount namespace (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html>mount_namespaces(7)</a>).  It
              supplies various information (e.g., propagation state,
              root of mount for bind mounts, identifier for each mount
              and its parent) that is missing from the (older)
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mounts</i> file, and fixes various other problems
              with that file (e.g., nonextensibility, failure to
              distinguish per-mount versus per-superblock options).

              The file contains lines of the form:

              36 35 98:0 /mnt1 /mnt2 rw,noatime master:1 - ext3 /dev/root rw,errors=continue
              (1)(2)(3)   (4)   (5)      (6)      (7)   (8) (9)   (10)         (11)

              The numbers in parentheses are labels for the descriptions
              below:

              (1)  mount ID: a unique ID for the mount (may be reused
                   after <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/umount.2.html>umount(2)</a>).

              (2)  parent ID: the ID of the parent mount (or of self for
                   the root of this mount namespace's mount tree).

                   If a new mount is stacked on top of a previous
                   existing mount (so that it hides the existing mount)
                   at pathname P, then the parent of the new mount is
                   the previous mount at that location.  Thus, when
                   looking at all the mounts stacked at a particular
                   location, the top-most mount is the one that is not
                   the parent of any other mount at the same location.
                   (Note, however, that this top-most mount will be
                   accessible only if the longest path subprefix of P
                   that is a mount point is not itself hidden by a
                   stacked mount.)

                   If the parent mount lies outside the process's root
                   directory (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html>chroot(2)</a>), the ID shown here won't
                   have a corresponding record in <i>mountinfo</i> whose mount
                   ID (field 1) matches this parent mount ID (because
                   mounts that lie outside the process's root directory
                   are not shown in <i>mountinfo</i>).  As a special case of
                   this point, the process's root mount may have a
                   parent mount (for the initramfs filesystem) that lies
                   outside the process's root directory, and an entry
                   for that mount will not appear in <i>mountinfo</i>.

              (3)  major:minor: the value of <i>st_dev</i> for files on this
                   filesystem (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/stat.2.html>stat(2)</a>).

              (4)  root: the pathname of the directory in the filesystem
                   which forms the root of this mount.

              (5)  mount point: the pathname of the mount point relative
                   to the process's root directory.

              (6)  mount options: per-mount options (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html>mount(2)</a>).

              (7)  optional fields: zero or more fields of the form
                   "tag[:value]"; see below.

              (8)  separator: the end of the optional fields is marked
                   by a single hyphen.

              (9)  filesystem type: the filesystem type in the form
                   "type[.subtype]".

              (10) mount source: filesystem-specific information or
                   "none".

              (11) super options: per-superblock options (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html>mount(2)</a>).

              Currently, the possible optional fields are <i>shared</i>,
              <i>master</i>, <i>propagate_from</i>, and <i>unbindable</i>.  See
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html>mount_namespaces(7)</a> for a description of these fields.
              Parsers should ignore all unrecognized optional fields.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mounts</i> (since Linux 2.4.19)
              This file lists all the filesystems currently mounted in
              the process's mount namespace (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html>mount_namespaces(7)</a>).

              Since Linux 2.6.15, this file is pollable: after opening
              the file for reading, a change in this file (i.e., a
              filesystem mount or unmount) causes <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html>select(2)</a> to mark the
              file descriptor as having an exceptional condition, and
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html>poll(2)</a> and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_wait.2.html>epoll_wait(2)</a> mark the file as having a
              priority event (<b>POLLPRI</b>).  (Before Linux 2.6.30, a change
              in this file was indicated by the file descriptor being
              marked as readable for <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/select.2.html>select(2)</a>, and being marked as
              having an error condition for <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/poll.2.html>poll(2)</a> and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_wait.2.html>epoll_wait(2)</a>.)

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/mountstats</i> (since Linux 2.6.17)
              This file exports information (statistics, configuration
              information) about the mounts in the process's mount
              namespace (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html>mount_namespaces(7)</a>).  Lines in this file
              have the form:

                  device /dev/sda7 mounted on /home with fstype ext3 [stats]
                  (       1      )            ( 2 )             (3 ) (  4  )

              The fields in each line are:

              (1)  The name of the mounted device (or "nodevice" if
                   there is no corresponding device).

              (2)  The mount point within the filesystem tree.

              (3)  The filesystem type.

              (4)  Optional statistics and configuration information.
                   Currently (as at Linux 2.6.26), only NFS filesystems
                   export information via this field.

              This file is readable only by the owner of the process.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_adj</i> (since Linux 2.6.11)
              This file can be used to adjust the score used to select
              which process should be killed in an out-of-memory (OOM)
              situation.  The kernel uses this value for a bit-shift
              operation of the process's <i>oom_score</i> value: valid values
              are in the range -16 to +15, plus the special value -17,
              which disables OOM-killing altogether for this process.  A
              positive score increases the likelihood of this process
              being killed by the OOM-killer; a negative score decreases
              the likelihood.

              The default value for this file is 0; a new process
              inherits its parent's <i>oom_adj</i> setting.  A process must be
              privileged (<b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b>) to update this file,
              although a process can always increase its own <i>oom_adj</i>
              setting (since Linux 2.6.20).

              Since Linux 2.6.36, use of this file is deprecated in
              favor of <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_score_adj</i>, and finally removed in
              Linux 3.7.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_score</i> (since Linux 2.6.11)
              This file displays the current score that the kernel gives
              to this process for the purpose of selecting a process for
              the OOM-killer.  A higher score means that the process is
              more likely to be selected by the OOM-killer.  The basis
              for this score is the amount of memory used by the
              process, with increases (+) or decreases (-) for factors
              including:

              •  whether the process is privileged (-).

              Before Linux 2.6.36 the following factors were also used
              in the calculation of oom_score:

              •  whether the process creates a lot of children using
                 <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html>fork(2)</a> (+);

              •  whether the process has been running a long time, or
                 has used a lot of CPU time (-);

              •  whether the process has a low nice value (i.e., &gt; 0)
                 (+); and

              •  whether the process is making direct hardware access
                 (-).

              The <i>oom_score</i> also reflects the adjustment specified by
              the <i>oom_score_adj</i> or <i>oom_adj</i> setting for the process.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_score_adj</i> (since Linux 2.6.36)
              This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used
              to select which process gets killed in out-of-memory
              conditions.

              The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate
              task ranging from 0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to
              determine which process is targeted.  The units are
              roughly a proportion along that range of allowed memory
              the process may allocate from, based on an estimation of
              its current memory and swap use.  For example, if a task
              is using all allowed memory, its badness score will be
              1000.  If it is using half of its allowed memory, its
              score will be 500.

              There is an additional factor included in the badness
              score: root processes are given 3% extra memory over other
              tasks.

              The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context in
              which the OOM-killer was called.  If it is due to the
              memory assigned to the allocating task's cpuset being
              exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mems
              assigned to that cpuset (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html>cpuset(7)</a>).  If it is due to
              a mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory
              represents the set of mempolicy nodes.  If it is due to a
              memory limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed
              memory is that configured limit.  Finally, if it is due to
              the entire system being out of memory, the allowed memory
              represents all allocatable resources.

              The value of <i>oom_score_adj</i> is added to the badness score
              before it is used to determine which task to kill.
              Acceptable values range from -1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to
              +1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX).  This allows user space to
              control the preference for OOM-killing, ranging from
              always preferring a certain task or completely disabling
              it from OOM-killing.  The lowest possible value, -1000, is
              equivalent to disabling OOM-killing entirely for that
              task, since it will always report a badness score of 0.

              Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define
              the amount of memory to consider for each task.  Setting
              an <i>oom_score_adj</i> value of +500, for example, is roughly
              equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing the
              same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller
              resources to use at least 50% more memory.  A value of
              -500, on the other hand, would be roughly equivalent to
              discounting 50% of the task's allowed memory from being
              considered as scoring against the task.

              For backward compatibility with previous kernels,
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_adj</i> can still be used to tune the badness
              score.  Its value is scaled linearly with <i>oom_score_adj</i>.

              Writing to <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_score_adj</i> or <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_adj</i>
              will change the other with its scaled value.

              The <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/choom.1.html>choom(1)</a> program provides a command-line interface for
              adjusting the <i>oom_score_adj</i> value of a running process or
              a newly executed command.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/pagemap</i> (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This file shows the mapping of each of the process's
              virtual pages into physical page frames or swap area.  It
              contains one 64-bit value for each virtual page, with the
              bits set as follows:

              63     If set, the page is present in RAM.

              62     If set, the page is in swap space

              61 (since Linux 3.5)
                     The page is a file-mapped page or a shared
                     anonymous page.

              60–58 (since Linux 3.11)
                     Zero

              57 (since Linux 5.14)
                     If set, the page is write-protected through
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html>userfaultfd(2)</a>.

              56 (since Linux 4.2)
                     The page is exclusively mapped.

              55 (since Linux 3.11)
                     PTE is soft-dirty (see the kernel source file
                     <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/soft-dirty.rst</i>).

              54–0   If the page is present in RAM (bit 63), then these
                     bits provide the page frame number, which can be
                     used to index <i>/proc/kpageflags</i> and
                     <i>/proc/kpagecount</i>.  If the page is present in swap
                     (bit 62), then bits 4–0 give the swap type, and
                     bits 54–5 encode the swap offset.

              Before Linux 3.11, bits 60–55 were used to encode the
              base-2 log of the page size.

              To employ <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/pagemap</i> efficiently, use
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/maps</i> to determine which areas of memory are
              actually mapped and seek to skip over unmapped regions.

              The <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/pagemap</i> file is present only if the
              <b>CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR </b>kernel configuration option is
              enabled.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/personality</i> (since Linux 2.6.28)
              This read-only file exposes the process's execution
              domain, as set by <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/personality.2.html>personality(2)</a>.  The value is displayed
              in hexadecimal notation.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/root</i>
              UNIX and Linux support the idea of a per-process root of
              the filesystem, set by the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chroot.2.html>chroot(2)</a> system call.  This
              file is a symbolic link that points to the process's root
              directory, and behaves in the same way as <i>exe</i>, and <i>fd/*</i>.

              Note however that this file is not merely a symbolic link.
              It provides the same view of the filesystem (including
              namespaces and the set of per-process mounts) as the
              process itself.  An example illustrates this point.  In
              one terminal, we start a shell in new user and mount
              namespaces, and in that shell we create some new mounts:

                  $ <b>PS1='sh1# ' unshare -Urnm</b>
                  sh1# <b>mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /etc  </b># Mount empty tmpfs at /etc
                  sh1# <b>mount --bind /usr /dev     </b># Mount /usr at /dev
                  sh1# <b>echo $$</b>
                  27123

              In a second terminal window, in the initial mount
              namespace, we look at the contents of the corresponding
              mounts in the initial and new namespaces:

                  $ <b>PS1='sh2# ' sudo sh</b>
                  sh2# <b>ls /etc | wc -l                  </b># In initial NS
                  309
                  sh2# <b>ls /proc/27123/root/etc | wc -l  </b># /etc in other NS
                  0                                     # The empty tmpfs dir
                  sh2# <b>ls /dev | wc -l                  </b># In initial NS
                  205
                  sh2# <b>ls /proc/27123/root/dev | wc -l  </b># /dev in other NS
                  11                                    # Actually bind
                                                        # mounted to /usr
                  sh2# <b>ls /usr | wc -l                  </b># /usr in initial NS
                  11

              In a multithreaded process, the contents of the
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/root</i> symbolic link are not available if the main
              thread has already terminated (typically by calling
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_exit.3.html>pthread_exit(3)</a>).

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/projid_map</i> (since Linux 3.7)
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html>user_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/seccomp</i> (Linux 2.6.12 to Linux 2.6.22)
              This file can be used to read and change the process's
              secure computing (seccomp) mode setting.  It contains the
              value 0 if the process is not in seccomp mode, and 1 if
              the process is in strict seccomp mode (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html>seccomp(2)</a>).
              Writing 1 to this file places the process irreversibly in
              strict seccomp mode.  (Further attempts to write to the
              file fail with the <b>EPERM </b>error.)

              In Linux 2.6.23, this file went away, to be replaced by
              the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_GET_SECCOMP </b>and <b>PR_SET_SECCOMP </b>operations
              (and later by <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html>seccomp(2)</a> and the <i>Seccomp</i> field in
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/status</i>).

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/smaps</i> (since Linux 2.6.14)
              This file shows memory consumption for each of the
              process's mappings.  (The <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/pmap.1.html>pmap(1)</a> command displays similar
              information, in a form that may be easier for parsing.)
              For each mapping there is a series of lines such as the
              following:

                  00400000-0048a000 r-xp 00000000 fd:03 960637       /bin/bash

                  VmFlags: rd ex mr mw me dw

              The first of these lines shows the same information as is
              displayed for the mapping in <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/maps</i>.  The
              following lines show the size of the mapping, the amount
              of the mapping that is currently resident in RAM ("Rss"),
              the process's proportional share of this mapping ("Pss"),
              the number of clean and dirty shared pages in the mapping,
              and the number of clean and dirty private pages in the
              mapping.  "Referenced" indicates the amount of memory
              currently marked as referenced or accessed.  "Anonymous"
              shows the amount of memory that does not belong to any
              file.  "Swap" shows how much would-be-anonymous memory is
              also used, but out on swap.

              The "KernelPageSize" line (available since Linux 2.6.29)
              is the page size used by the kernel to back the virtual
              memory area.  This matches the size used by the MMU in the
              majority of cases.  However, one counter-example occurs on
              PPC64 kernels whereby a kernel using 64 kB as a base page
              size may still use 4 kB pages for the MMU on older
              processors.  To distinguish the two attributes, the
              "MMUPageSize" line (also available since Linux 2.6.29)
              reports the page size used by the MMU.

              The "Locked" indicates whether the mapping is locked in
              memory or not.

              The "ProtectionKey" line (available since Linux 4.9, on
              x86 only) contains the memory protection key (see
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pkeys.7.html>pkeys(7)</a>) associated with the virtual memory area.  This
              entry is present only if the kernel was built with the
              <b>CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MEMORY_PROTECTION_KEYS </b>configuration
              option (since Linux 4.6).

              The "VmFlags" line (available since Linux 3.8) represents
              the kernel flags associated with the virtual memory area,
              encoded using the following two-letter codes:

                     rd   -   readable

              (7) <i>tty_nr</i>  %d
                     The controlling terminal of the process.  (The
                     minor device number is contained in the combination
                     of bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device
                     number is in bits 15 to 8.)

              (8) <i>tpgid</i>  %d
                     The ID of the foreground process group of the

                     source file <i>include/linux/sched.h</i>.  Details depend
                     on the kernel version.

                     The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (10) <i>minflt</i>  %lu
                     The number of minor faults the process has made
                     which have not required loading a memory page from
                     disk.

              (11) <i>cminflt</i>  %lu
                     The number of minor faults that the process's

              (12) <i>majflt</i>  %lu
                     The number of major faults the process has made
                     which have required loading a memory page from

              (13) <i>cmajflt</i>  %lu
                     The number of major faults that the process's

              (14) <i>utime</i>  %lu
                     Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
                     in user mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
                     <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).  This includes guest time,
                     <i>guest_time</i> (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
                     below), so that applications that are not aware of
                     the guest time field do not lose that time from
                     their calculations.

              (15) <i>stime</i>  %lu
                     Amount of time that this process has been scheduled
                     in kernel mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
                     <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).

              (16) <i>cutime</i>  %ld
                     Amount of time that this process's waited-for
                     children have been scheduled in user mode, measured
                     in clock ticks (divide by <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).
                     (See also <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/times.2.html>times(2)</a>.)  This includes guest time,
                     <i>cguest_time</i> (time spent running a virtual CPU, see
                     below).

              (17) <i>cstime</i>  %ld
                     Amount of time that this process's waited-for
                     children have been scheduled in kernel mode,
                     measured in clock ticks (divide by
                     <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).

              (18) <i>priority</i>  %ld
                     (Explanation for Linux 2.6) For processes running a
                     real-time scheduling policy (<i>policy</i> below; see
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sched_setscheduler.2.html>sched_setscheduler(2)</a>), this is the negated
                     scheduling priority, minus one; that is, a number
                     in the range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time
                     priorities 1 to 99.  For processes running under a
                     non-real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw
                     nice value (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpriority.2.html>setpriority(2)</a>) as represented in the
                     kernel.  The kernel stores nice values as numbers
                     in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low), corresponding to
                     the user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.

                     Before Linux 2.6, this was a scaled value based on
                     the scheduler weighting given to this process.

              (19) <i>nice</i>  %ld
                     The nice value (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setpriority.2.html>setpriority(2)</a>), a value in the
                     range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).

              (20) <i>num_threads</i>  %ld
                     Number of threads in this process (since Linux
                     2.6).  Before Linux 2.6, this field was hard coded
                     to 0 as a placeholder for an earlier removed field.

              (21) <i>itrealvalue</i>  %ld
                     The time in jiffies before the next <b>SIGALRM </b>is sent
                     to the process due to an interval timer.  Since
                     Linux 2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained,
                     and is hard coded as 0.

              (22) <i>starttime</i>  %llu
                     The time the process started after system boot.
                     Before Linux 2.6, this value was expressed in
                     jiffies.  Since Linux 2.6, the value is expressed
                     in clock ticks (divide by <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i>).

                     The format for this field was %lu before Linux 2.6.

              (23) <i>vsize</i>  %lu
                     Virtual memory size in bytes.

              (24) <i>rss</i>  %ld
                     Resident Set Size: number of pages the process has
                     in real memory.  This is just the pages which count
                     toward text, data, or stack space.  This does not
                     include pages which have not been demand-loaded in,
                     or which are swapped out.  This value is
                     inaccurate; see <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/statm</i> below.

              (25) <i>rsslim</i>  %lu

                     The current value of ESP (stack pointer), as found
                     in the kernel stack page for the process.

              (30) <i>kstkeip</i>  %lu  [PT]
                     The current EIP (instruction pointer).

                     The bitmap of pending signals, displayed as a
                     decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
                     provide information on real-time signals; use
                     <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/status</i> instead.

              (32) <i>blocked</i>  %lu
                     The bitmap of blocked signals, displayed as a
                     decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
                     provide information on real-time signals; use

              (33) <i>sigignore</i>  %lu
                     The bitmap of ignored signals, displayed as a
                     decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not
                     provide information on real-time signals; use

              (34) <i>sigcatch</i>  %lu
                     The bitmap of caught signals, displayed as a
                     decimal number.  Obsolete, because it does not

                     This is the "channel" in which the process is
                     waiting.  It is the address of a location in the
                     kernel where the process is sleeping.  The
                     corresponding symbolic name can be found in

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/statm</i>
              Provides information about memory usage, measured in
              pages.  The columns are:

                  size       (1) total program size
                             (same as VmSize in <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/status</i>)
                  resident   (2) resident set size
                             (inaccurate; same as VmRSS in <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/status</i>)
                  shared     (3) number of resident shared pages

                  dt         (7) dirty pages (unused since Linux 2.6; always 0)

              Some of these values are inaccurate because of a kernel-
              internal scalability optimization.  If accurate values are
              required, use <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/smaps</i> or <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/smaps_rollup</i>
              instead, which are much slower but provide accurate,
              detailed information.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/status</i>
              Provides much of the information in <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/stat</i> and
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/statm</i> in a format that's easier for humans to
              parse.  Here's an example:

              <i>VmHWM</i>  Peak resident set size ("high water mark").  This
                     value is inaccurate; see <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/statm</i> above.

                     sum of <i>RssAnon</i>, <i>RssFile</i>, and <i>RssShmem</i>.  This value
                     is inaccurate; see <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/statm</i> above.

              <i>RssAnon</i>
                     Size of resident anonymous memory.  (since Linux
                     4.5).  This value is inaccurate; see
                     <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/statm</i> above.

              <i>RssFile</i>
                     Size of resident file mappings.  (since Linux 4.5).
                     This value is inaccurate; see <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/statm</i>
                     above.

              <i>RssShmem</i>
                     Size of resident shared memory (includes System V
                     shared memory, mappings from <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/tmpfs.5.html>tmpfs(5)</a>, and shared
                     anonymous mappings).  (since Linux 4.5).

              <i>VmData</i>, <i>VmStk</i>, <i>VmExe</i>
                     Size of data, stack, and text segments.  This value
                     is inaccurate; see <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/statm</i> above.

              <i>VmLib</i>  Shared library code size.

              <i>VmPTE</i>  Page table entries size (since Linux 2.6.10).

                     4.0; removed in Linux 4.15).

              <i>VmSwap</i> Swapped-out virtual memory size by anonymous
                     private pages; shmem swap usage is not included
                     (since Linux 2.6.34).  This value is inaccurate;

              <i>HugetlbPages</i>
                     Size of hugetlb memory portions (since Linux 4.4).

              <i>CoreDumping</i>
                     Contains the value 1 if the process is currently
                     dumping core, and 0 if it is not (since Linux
                     4.15).  This information can be used by a
                     monitoring process to avoid killing a process that
                     is currently dumping core, which could result in a
                     corrupted core dump file.

              <i>Threads</i>
                     Number of threads in process containing this

              <i>SigQ</i>   This field contains two slash-separated numbers
                     that relate to queued signals for the real user ID
                     of this process.  The first of these is the number
                     of currently queued signals for this real user ID,
                     and the second is the resource limit on the number
                     of queued signals for this process (see the
                     description of <b>RLIMIT_SIGPENDING </b>in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html>getrlimit(2)</a>).

                     <b>SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER</b>.  This field is provided only
                     if the kernel was built with the <b>CONFIG_SECCOMP</b>
                     kernel configuration option enabled.

              <i>Speculation_Store_Bypass</i>
                     Speculation flaw mitigation state (since Linux
                     4.17, see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a>).

              <i>Cpus_allowed</i>
                     Hexadecimal mask of CPUs on which this process may

              <i>Cpus_allowed_list</i>
                     Same as previous, but in "list format" (since Linux
                     2.6.26, see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html>cpuset(7)</a>).

              <i>Mems_allowed</i>
                     Mask of memory nodes allowed to this process (since
                     Linux 2.6.24, see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html>cpuset(7)</a>).

              <i>Mems_allowed_list</i>
                     Same as previous, but in "list format" (since Linux
                     2.6.26, see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html>cpuset(7)</a>).

              <i>voluntary_ctxt_switches</i>, <i>nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches</i>
                     Number of voluntary and involuntary context
                     switches (since Linux 2.6.23).

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/syscall</i> (since Linux 2.6.27)
              This file exposes the system call number and argument
              registers for the system call currently being executed by
              the process, followed by the values of the stack pointer
              and program counter registers.  The values of all six
              argument registers are exposed, although most system calls
              use fewer registers.

              If the process is blocked, but not in a system call, then
              the file displays -1 in place of the system call number,
              followed by just the values of the stack pointer and
              program counter.  If process is not blocked, then the file
              contains just the string "running".

              This file is present only if the kernel was configured
              with <b>CONFIG_HAVE_ARCH_TRACEHOOK</b>.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace
              access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS </b>check; see
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html>ptrace(2)</a>.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This is a directory that contains one subdirectory for
              each thread in the process.  The name of each subdirectory
              is the numerical thread ID (<i>tid</i>) of the thread (see
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/gettid.2.html>gettid(2)</a>).

              Within each of these subdirectories, there is a set of
              files with the same names and contents as under the
              <i>/proc/</i>pid directories.  For attributes that are shared by
              all threads, the contents for each of the files under the
              <i>task/</i>tid subdirectories will be the same as in the
              corresponding file in the parent <i>/proc/</i>pid directory
              (e.g., in a multithreaded process, all of the <i>task/</i>tid<i>/cwd</i>
              files will have the same value as the <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/cwd</i> file
              in the parent directory, since all of the threads in a
              process share a working directory).  For attributes that
              are distinct for each thread, the corresponding files
              under <i>task/</i>tid may have different values (e.g., various
              fields in each of the <i>task/</i>tid<i>/status</i> files may be
              different for each thread), or they might not exist in
              <i>/proc/</i>pid at all.

              In a multithreaded process, the contents of the
              <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task</i> directory are not available if the main
              thread has already terminated (typically by calling
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/pthread_exit.3.html>pthread_exit(3)</a>).

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task/</i>tid<i>/children</i> (since Linux 3.5)
              A space-separated list of child tasks of this task.  Each
              child task is represented by its TID.

              This option is intended for use by the checkpoint-restore
              (CRIU) system, and reliably provides a list of children
              only if all of the child processes are stopped or frozen.
              It does not work properly if children of the target task
              exit while the file is being read!  Exiting children may
              cause non-exiting children to be omitted from the list.
              This makes this interface even more unreliable than
              classic PID-based approaches if the inspected task and its
              children aren't frozen, and most code should probably not
              use this interface.

              Until Linux 4.2, the presence of this file was governed by
              the <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE </b>kernel configuration option.
              Since Linux 4.2, it is governed by the
              <b>CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN </b>option.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/timers</i> (since Linux 3.10)
              A list of the POSIX timers for this process.  Each timer
              is listed with a line that starts with the string "ID:".
              For example:

                  ID: 1
                  signal: 60/00007fff86e452a8
                  notify: signal/pid.2634
                  ClockID: 0
                  ID: 0
                  signal: 60/00007fff86e452a8
                  notify: signal/pid.2634
                  ClockID: 1

              The lines shown for each timer have the following
              meanings:

              <i>ID</i>     The ID for this timer.  This is not the same as the
                     timer ID returned by <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timer_create.2.html>timer_create(2)</a>; rather, it is
                     the same kernel-internal ID that is available via
                     the <i>si_timerid</i> field of the <i>siginfo_t</i> structure
                     (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html>sigaction(2)</a>).

              <i>signal</i> This is the signal number that this timer uses to
                     deliver notifications followed by a slash, and then
                     the <i>sigev_value</i> value supplied to the signal
                     handler.  Valid only for timers that notify via a
                     signal.

              <i>notify</i> The part before the slash specifies the mechanism
                     that this timer uses to deliver notifications, and
                     is one of "thread", "signal", or "none".
                     Immediately following the slash is either the
                     string "tid" for timers with <b>SIGEV_THREAD_ID</b>
                     notification, or "pid" for timers that notify by
                     other mechanisms.  Following the "." is the PID of
                     the process (or the kernel thread ID of the thread)
                     that will be delivered a signal if the timer
                     delivers notifications via a signal.

              <i>ClockID</i>
                     This field identifies the clock that the timer uses
                     for measuring time.  For most clocks, this is a
                     number that matches one of the user-space <b>CLOCK_*</b>
                     constants exposed via <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i>.
                     <b>CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID </b>timers display with a
                     value of -6 in this field.  <b>CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID</b>
                     timers display with a value of -2 in this field.

              This file is available only when the kernel was configured
              with <b>CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE</b>.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/timerslack_ns</i> (since Linux 4.6)
              This file exposes the process's "current" timer slack
              value, expressed in nanoseconds.  The file is writable,
              allowing the process's timer slack value to be changed.
              Writing 0 to this file resets the "current" timer slack to
              the "default" timer slack value.  For further details, see
              the discussion of <b>PR_SET_TIMERSLACK </b>in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a>.

              Initially, permission to access this file was governed by
              a ptrace access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS </b>check (see
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html>ptrace(2)</a>).  However, this was subsequently deemed too
              strict a requirement (and had the side effect that
              requiring a process to have the <b>CAP_SYS_PTRACE </b>capability
              would also allow it to view and change any process's
              memory).  Therefore, since Linux 4.9, only the (weaker)
              <b>CAP_SYS_NICE </b>capability is required to access this file.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/uid_map</i> (since Linux 3.5)
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html>user_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/wchan</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              The symbolic name corresponding to the location in the
              kernel where the process is sleeping.

              Permission to access this file is governed by a ptrace
              access mode <b>PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS </b>check; see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html>ptrace(2)</a>.

       <i>/proc/</i>tid
              There  is a numerical subdirectory for each running thread
              that is not a thread group leader (i.e., a thread whose
              thread ID is not the same as its process ID); the
              subdirectory is named by the thread ID.  Each one of these
              subdirectories contains files and subdirectories exposing
              information about the thread with the thread ID <i>tid</i>.  The
              contents of these directories are the same as the
              corresponding <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/task/</i>tid directories.

              The <i>/proc/</i>tid subdirectories are <i>not</i> visible when
              iterating through <i>/proc</i> with <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getdents.2.html>getdents(2)</a> (and thus are <i>not</i>
              visible when one uses <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html>ls(1)</a> to view the contents of
              <i>/proc</i>).  However, the pathnames of these directories are
              visible to (i.e., usable as arguments in) system calls
              that operate on pathnames.

       <i>/proc/apm</i>
              Advanced power management version and battery information
              when <b>CONFIG_APM </b>is defined at kernel compilation time.

       <i>/proc/buddyinfo</i>
              This file contains information which is used for
              diagnosing memory fragmentation issues.  Each line starts
              with the identification of the node and the name of the
              zone which together identify a memory region.  This is
              then followed by the count of available chunks of a
              certain order in which these zones are split.  The size in
              bytes of a certain order is given by the formula:

                  (2^order) * PAGE_SIZE

              The binary buddy allocator algorithm inside the kernel
              will split one chunk into two chunks of a smaller order
              (thus with half the size) or combine two contiguous chunks
              into one larger chunk of a higher order (thus with double
              the size) to satisfy allocation requests and to counter
              memory fragmentation.  The order matches the column
              number, when starting to count at zero.

              For example on an x86-64 system:
         Node 0, zone     DMA     1    1    1    0    2    1    1    0    1    1    3
         Node 0, zone   DMA32    65   47    4   81   52   28   13   10    5    1  404
         Node 0, zone  Normal   216   55  189  101   84   38   37   27    5    3  587

              In this example, there is one node containing three zones
              and there are 11 different chunk sizes.  If the page size
              is 4 kilobytes, then the first zone called <i>DMA</i> (on x86 the
              first 16 megabyte of memory) has 1 chunk of 4 kilobytes
              (order 0) available and has 3 chunks of 4 megabytes (order
              10) available.

              If the memory is heavily fragmented, the counters for
              higher order chunks will be zero and allocation of large
              contiguous areas will fail.

              Further information about the zones can be found in
              <i>/proc/zoneinfo</i>.

       <i>/proc/bus</i>
              Contains subdirectories for installed buses.

       <i>/proc/bus/pccard</i>
              Subdirectory for PCMCIA devices when <b>CONFIG_PCMCIA </b>is set
              at kernel compilation time.

       <i>/proc/bus/pccard/drivers</i>

       <i>/proc/bus/pci</i>
              Contains various bus subdirectories and pseudo-files
              containing information about PCI buses, installed devices,
              and device drivers.  Some of these files are not ASCII.

       <i>/proc/bus/pci/devices</i>
              Information about PCI devices.  They may be accessed
              through <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lspci.8.html>lspci(8)</a> and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/setpci.8.html>setpci(8)</a>.

              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html>cgroups(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/cmdline</i>
              Arguments passed to the Linux kernel at boot time.  Often
              done via a boot manager such as <b>lilo</b>(8) or <b>grub</b>(8).  Any
              arguments embedded in the kernel image or initramfs via
              <b>CONFIG_BOOT_CONFIG </b>will also be displayed.

       <i>/proc/config.gz</i> (since Linux 2.6)
              This file exposes the configuration options that were used
              to build the currently running kernel, in the same format
              as they would be shown in the <i>.config</i> file that resulted
              when configuring the kernel (using <i>make xconfig</i>, <i>make</i>
              <i>config</i>, or similar).  The file contents are compressed;
              view or search them using <b>zcat</b>(1) and <b>zgrep</b>(1).  As long
              as no changes have been made to the following file, the
              contents of <i>/proc/config.gz</i> are the same as those provided
              by:

                  cat /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/.config

              <i>/proc/config.gz</i> is provided only if the kernel is
              configured with <b>CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC</b>.

       <i>/proc/crypto</i>
              A list of the ciphers provided by the kernel crypto API.
              For details, see the kernel <i>Linux Kernel Crypto API</i>
              documentation available under the kernel source directory
              <i>Documentation/crypto/</i> (or <i>Documentation/DocBook</i> before
              Linux 4.10; the documentation can be built using a command
              such as <i>make htmldocs</i> in the root directory of the kernel
              source tree).

       <i>/proc/cpuinfo</i>
              This is a collection of CPU and system architecture
              dependent items, for each supported architecture a
              different list.  Two common entries are <i>processor</i> which
              gives CPU number and <i>bogomips</i>; a system constant that is
              calculated during kernel initialization.  SMP machines
              have information for each CPU.  The <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lscpu.1.html>lscpu(1)</a> command
              gathers its information from this file.

       <i>/proc/devices</i>
              Text listing of major numbers and device groups.  This can
              be used by MAKEDEV scripts for consistency with the
              kernel.

       <i>/proc/diskstats</i> (since Linux 2.5.69)
              This file contains disk I/O statistics for each disk
              device.  See the Linux kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/admin-guide/iostats.rst</i> (or
              <i>Documentation/iostats.txt</i> before Linux 5.3) for further
              information.

       <i>/proc/dma</i>
              This is a list of the registered <i>ISA</i> DMA (direct memory
              access) channels in use.

       <i>/proc/driver</i>
              Empty subdirectory.

       <i>/proc/execdomains</i>
              Used to list ABI personalities before Linux 4.1; now
              contains a constant string for userspace compatibility.

       <i>/proc/fb</i>
              Frame buffer information when <b>CONFIG_FB </b>is defined during
              kernel compilation.

       <i>/proc/filesystems</i>
              A text listing of the filesystems which are supported by
              the kernel, namely filesystems which were compiled into
              the kernel or whose kernel modules are currently loaded.
              (See also <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/filesystems.5.html>filesystems(5)</a>.)  If a filesystem is marked with
              "nodev", this means that it does not require a block
              device to be mounted (e.g., virtual filesystem, network
              filesystem).

              Incidentally, this file may be used by <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mount.8.html>mount(8)</a> when no
              filesystem is specified and it didn't manage to determine
              the filesystem type.  Then filesystems contained in this
              file are tried (excepted those that are marked with
              "nodev").

       <i>/proc/fs</i>
              Contains subdirectories that in turn contain files with
              information about (certain) mounted filesystems.

       <i>/proc/ide</i>
              This directory exists on systems with the IDE bus.  There
              are directories for each IDE channel and attached device.
              Files include:

                  cache              buffer size in KB
                  capacity           number of sectors
                  driver             driver version
                  geometry           physical and logical geometry
                  identify           in hexadecimal
                  media              media type
                  model              manufacturer's model number
                  settings           drive settings
                  smart_thresholds   IDE disk management thresholds (in hex)
                  smart_values       IDE disk management values (in hex)

              The <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/hdparm.8.html>hdparm(8)</a> utility provides access to this information
              in a friendly format.

       <i>/proc/interrupts</i>
              This is used to record the number of interrupts per CPU
              per IO device.  Since Linux 2.6.24, for the i386 and
              x86-64 architectures, at least, this also includes
              interrupts internal to the system (that is, not associated
              with a device as such), such as NMI (nonmaskable
              interrupt), LOC (local timer interrupt), and for SMP
              systems, TLB (TLB flush interrupt), RES (rescheduling
              interrupt), CAL (remote function call interrupt), and
              possibly others.  Very easy to read formatting, done in
              ASCII.

       <i>/proc/iomem</i>
              I/O memory map in Linux 2.4.

       <i>/proc/ioports</i>
              This is a list of currently registered Input-Output port
              regions that are in use.

       <i>/proc/kallsyms</i> (since Linux 2.5.71)
              This holds the kernel exported symbol definitions used by
              the <b>modules</b>(X) tools to dynamically link and bind loadable
              modules.  In Linux 2.5.47 and earlier, a similar file with
              slightly different syntax was named <i>ksyms</i>.

       <i>/proc/kcore</i>
              This file represents the physical memory of the system and
              is stored in the ELF core file format.  With this pseudo-
              file, and an unstripped kernel (<i>/usr/src/linux/vmlinux</i>)
              binary, GDB can be used to examine the current state of
              any kernel data structures.

              The total length of the file is the size of physical
              memory (RAM) plus 4 KiB.

       <i>/proc/keys</i> (since Linux 2.6.10)
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyrings.7.html>keyrings(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/kmsg</i>
              This file can be used instead of the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syslog.2.html>syslog(2)</a> system call
              to read kernel messages.  A process must have superuser
              privileges to read this file, and only one process should
              read this file.  This file should not be read if a syslog
              process is running which uses the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syslog.2.html>syslog(2)</a> system call
              facility to log kernel messages.

              Information in this file is retrieved with the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/dmesg.1.html>dmesg(1)</a>
              program.

       <i>/proc/kpagecgroup</i> (since Linux 4.3)
              This file contains a 64-bit inode number of the memory
              cgroup each page is charged to, indexed by page frame
              number (see the discussion of <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/pagemap</i>).

              The <i>/proc/kpagecgroup</i> file is present only if the
              <b>CONFIG_MEMCG </b>kernel configuration option is enabled.

       <i>/proc/kpagecount</i> (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This file contains a 64-bit count of the number of times
              each physical page frame is mapped, indexed by page frame
              number (see the discussion of <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/pagemap</i>).

              The <i>/proc/kpagecount</i> file is present only if the

              The <i>/proc/kpageflags</i> file is present only if the
              <b>CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR </b>kernel configuration option is
              enabled.

       <i>/proc/ksyms</i> (Linux 1.1.23–2.5.47)
              See <i>/proc/kallsyms</i>.

       <i>/proc/loadavg</i>
              The first three fields in this file are load average
              figures giving the number of jobs in the run queue (state
              R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5,
              and 15 minutes.  They are the same as the load average
              numbers given by <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/uptime.1.html>uptime(1)</a> and other programs.  The fourth
              field consists of two numbers separated by a slash (/).
              The first of these is the number of currently runnable
              kernel scheduling entities (processes, threads).  The
              value after the slash is the number of kernel scheduling
              entities that currently exist on the system.  The fifth
              field is the PID of the process that was most recently
              created on the system.

       <i>/proc/locks</i>
              This file shows current file locks (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/flock.2.html>flock(2)</a> and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html>fcntl(2)</a>)
              and leases (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html>fcntl(2)</a>).

              An example of the content shown in this file is the
              following:

                  1: POSIX  ADVISORY  READ  5433 08:01:7864448 128 128
                  2: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 2001 08:01:7864554 0 EOF
                  3: FLOCK  ADVISORY  WRITE 1568 00:2f:32388 0 EOF
                  4: POSIX  ADVISORY  WRITE 699 00:16:28457 0 EOF

                  8: OFDLCK ADVISORY  WRITE -1 08:01:8713209 128 191

              The fields shown in each line are as follows:

              [1]  The ordinal position of the lock in the list.

              [2]  The lock type.  Values that may appear here include:

                   <b>FLOCK  </b>This is a BSD file lock created using
                          <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/flock.2.html>flock(2)</a>.

                   <b>OFDLCK </b>This is an open file description (OFD) lock
                          created using <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html>fcntl(2)</a>.

                   <b>POSIX  </b>This is a POSIX byte-range lock created using
                          <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html>fcntl(2)</a>.

              [3]  Among the strings that can appear here are the
                   following:

                   <b>ADVISORY</b>
                          This is an advisory lock.

                   <b>MANDATORY</b>
                          This is a mandatory lock.

              [4]  The type of lock.  Values that can appear here are:

                   <b>READ   </b>This is a POSIX or OFD read lock, or a BSD
                          shared lock.

                   <b>WRITE  </b>This is a POSIX or OFD write lock, or a BSD
                          exclusive lock.

              [5]  The PID of the process that owns the lock.

                   Because OFD locks are not owned by a single process
                   (since multiple processes may have file descriptors
                   that refer to the same open file description), the
                   value -1 is displayed in this field for OFD locks.
                   (Before Linux 4.14, a bug meant that the PID of the
                   process that initially acquired the lock was
                   displayed instead of the value -1.)

              [6]  Three colon-separated subfields that identify the
                   major and minor device ID of the device containing
                   the filesystem where the locked file resides,
                   followed by the inode number of the locked file.

              [7]  The byte offset of the first byte of the lock.  For
                   BSD locks, this value is always 0.

              [8]  The byte offset of the last byte of the lock.  <b>EOF </b>in
                   this field means that the lock extends to the end of
                   the file.  For BSD locks, the value shown is always
                   <i>EOF</i>.

              Since Linux 4.9, the list of locks shown in <i>/proc/locks</i> is
              filtered to show just the locks for the processes in the
              PID namespace (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html>pid_namespaces(7)</a>) for which the <i>/proc</i>
              filesystem was mounted.  (In the initial PID namespace,
              there is no filtering of the records shown in this file.)

              The <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lslocks.8.html>lslocks(8)</a> command provides a bit more information
              about each lock.

       <i>/proc/malloc</i> (only up to and including Linux 2.2)
              This file is present only if <b>CONFIG_DEBUG_MALLOC </b>was
              defined during compilation.

       <i>/proc/meminfo</i>
              This file reports statistics about memory usage on the
              system.  It is used by <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/free.1.html>free(1)</a> to report the amount of
              free and used memory (both physical and swap) on the
              system as well as the shared memory and buffers used by
              the kernel.  Each line of the file consists of a parameter
              name, followed by a colon, the value of the parameter, and
              an option unit of measurement (e.g., "kB").  The list
              below describes the parameter names and the format
              specifier required to read the field value.  Except as
              noted below, all of the fields have been present since at
              least Linux 2.6.0.  Some fields are displayed only if the
              kernel was configured with various options; those
              dependencies are noted in the list.

              <i>MemTotal</i> %lu
                     Total usable RAM (i.e., physical RAM minus a few
                     reserved bits and the kernel binary code).

              <i>MemFree</i> %lu
                     The sum of <i>LowFree</i>+<i>HighFree</i>.

              <i>MemAvailable</i> %lu (since Linux 3.14)
                     An estimate of how much memory is available for
                     starting new applications, without swapping.

              <i>Buffers</i> %lu
                     Relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks
                     that shouldn't get tremendously large (20 MB or
                     so).

              <i>Cached</i> %lu
                     In-memory cache for files read from the disk (the
                     page cache).  Doesn't include <i>SwapCached</i>.

              <i>SwapCached</i> %lu
                     Memory that once was swapped out, is swapped back
                     in but still also is in the swap file.  (If memory
                     pressure is high, these pages don't need to be
                     swapped out again because they are already in the
                     swap file.  This saves I/O.)

              <i>Active</i> %lu
                     Memory that has been used more recently and usually
                     not reclaimed unless absolutely necessary.

              <i>Inactive</i> %lu
                     Memory which has been less recently used.  It is
                     more eligible to be reclaimed for other purposes.

              <i>Active(anon)</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     [To be documented.]

              <i>Inactive(anon)</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     [To be documented.]

              <i>Active(file)</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     [To be documented.]

              <i>Inactive(file)</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     [To be documented.]

              <i>Unevictable</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     (From Linux 2.6.28 to Linux 2.6.30,
                     <b>CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU </b>was required.)  [To be
                     documented.]

              <i>Mlocked</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.28)
                     (From Linux 2.6.28 to Linux 2.6.30,
                     <b>CONFIG_UNEVICTABLE_LRU </b>was required.)  [To be
                     documented.]

              <i>HighTotal</i> %lu
                     (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, <b>CONFIG_HIGHMEM </b>is
                     required.)  Total amount of highmem.  Highmem is
                     all memory above ~860 MB of physical memory.
                     Highmem areas are for use by user-space programs,
                     or for the page cache.  The kernel must use tricks
                     to access this memory, making it slower to access
                     than lowmem.

              <i>HighFree</i> %lu
                     (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, <b>CONFIG_HIGHMEM </b>is
                     required.)  Amount of free highmem.

              <i>LowTotal</i> %lu
                     (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, <b>CONFIG_HIGHMEM </b>is
                     required.)  Total amount of lowmem.  Lowmem is
                     memory which can be used for everything that
                     highmem can be used for, but it is also available
                     for the kernel's use for its own data structures.
                     Among many other things, it is where everything
                     from <i>Slab</i> is allocated.  Bad things happen when
                     you're out of lowmem.

              <i>LowFree</i> %lu
                     (Starting with Linux 2.6.19, <b>CONFIG_HIGHMEM </b>is
                     required.)  Amount of free lowmem.

              <i>MmapCopy</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.29)
                     (<b>CONFIG_MMU </b>is required.)  [To be documented.]

              <i>SwapTotal</i> %lu
                     Total amount of swap space available.

              <i>SwapFree</i> %lu
                     Amount of swap space that is currently unused.

              <i>Dirty</i> %lu
                     Memory which is waiting to get written back to the
                     disk.

              <i>Writeback</i> %lu
                     Memory which is actively being written back to the
                     disk.

              <i>AnonPages</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)
                     Non-file backed pages mapped into user-space page
                     tables.

              <i>Mapped</i> %lu
                     Files which have been mapped into memory (with
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>mmap(2)</a>), such as libraries.

              <i>Shmem</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.32)
                     Amount of memory consumed in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/tmpfs.5.html>tmpfs(5)</a> filesystems.

              <i>KReclaimable</i> %lu (since Linux 4.20)
                     Kernel allocations that the kernel will attempt to
                     reclaim under memory pressure.  Includes
                     <i>SReclaimable</i> (below), and other direct allocations
                     with a shrinker.

              <i>Slab</i> %lu
                     In-kernel data structures cache.  (See
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/slabinfo.5.html>slabinfo(5)</a>.)

              <i>SReclaimable</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.19)
                     Part of <i>Slab</i>, that might be reclaimed, such as
                     caches.

              <i>SUnreclaim</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.19)
                     Part of <i>Slab</i>, that cannot be reclaimed on memory
                     pressure.

              <i>KernelStack</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.32)
                     Amount of memory allocated to kernel stacks.

              <i>PageTables</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)
                     Amount of memory dedicated to the lowest level of
                     page tables.

              <i>Quicklists</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.27)
                     (<b>CONFIG_QUICKLIST </b>is required.)  [To be
                     documented.]

              <i>NFS_Unstable</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)
                     NFS pages sent to the server, but not yet committed
                     to stable storage.

              <i>Bounce</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.18)
                     Memory used for block device "bounce buffers".

              <i>WritebackTmp</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.26)
                     Memory used by FUSE for temporary writeback
                     buffers.

              <i>CommitLimit</i> %lu (since Linux 2.6.10)
                     This is the total amount of memory currently
                     available to be allocated on the system, expressed
                     in kilobytes.  This limit is adhered to only if
                     strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in
                     <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>).  The limit is
                     calculated according to the formula described under
                     <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>.  For further
                     details, see the kernel source file
                     <i>Documentation/vm/overcommit-accounting.rst</i>.

              <i>Committed_AS</i> %lu
                     The amount of memory presently allocated on the
                     system.  The committed memory is a sum of all of
                     the memory which has been allocated by processes,
                     even if it has not been "used" by them as of yet.
                     A process which allocates 1 GB of memory (using
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html>malloc(3)</a> or similar), but touches only 300 MB of
                     that memory will show up as using only 300 MB of
                     memory even if it has the address space allocated
                     for the entire 1 GB.

                     This 1 GB is memory which has been "committed" to
                     by the VM and can be used at any time by the
                     allocating application.  With strict overcommit
                     enabled on the system (mode 2 in
                     <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>), allocations which
                     would exceed the <i>CommitLimit</i> will not be permitted.
                     This is useful if one needs to guarantee that
                     processes will not fail due to lack of memory once
                     that memory has been successfully allocated.

              <i>VmallocTotal</i> %lu
                     Total size of vmalloc memory area.

              <i>VmallocUsed</i> %lu
                     Amount of vmalloc area which is used.  Since Linux
                     4.4, this field is no longer calculated, and is
                     hard coded as 0.  See <i>/proc/vmallocinfo</i>.

              <i>VmallocChunk</i> %lu
                     Largest contiguous block of vmalloc area which is
                     free.  Since Linux 4.4, this field is no longer
                     calculated and is hard coded as 0.  See

              <i>HugePages_Total</i> %lu
                     (<b>CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE </b>is required.)  The size of the

                     (<b>CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE </b>is required.)  This is the
                     number of huge pages for which a commitment to
                     allocate from the pool has been made, but no
                     allocation has yet been made.  These reserved huge
                     pages guarantee that an application will be able to
                     allocate a huge page from the pool of huge pages at
                     fault time.

       <i>/proc/modules</i>
              A text list of the modules that have been loaded by the
              system.  See also <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/lsmod.8.html>lsmod(8)</a>.

       <i>/proc/mounts</i>
              Before Linux 2.4.19, this file was a list of all the
              filesystems currently mounted on the system.  With the
              introduction of per-process mount namespaces in Linux
              2.4.19 (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html>mount_namespaces(7)</a>), this file became a link
              to <i>/proc/self/mounts</i>, which lists the mounts of the
              process's own mount namespace.  The format of this file is
              documented in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/fstab.5.html>fstab(5)</a>.

       <i>/proc/mtrr</i>
              Memory Type Range Registers.  See the Linux kernel source
              file <i>Documentation/x86/mtrr.rst</i> (or
              <i>Documentation/x86/mtrr.txt</i> before Linux 5.2, or
              <i>Documentation/mtrr.txt</i> before Linux 2.6.28) for details.

       <i>/proc/net</i>
              This directory contains various files and subdirectories
              containing information about the networking layer.  The
              files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore,
              readable with <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html>cat(1)</a>.  However, the standard <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/netstat.8.html>netstat(8)</a>
              suite provides much cleaner access to these files.

              With the advent of network namespaces, various information
              relating to the network stack is virtualized (see
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html>network_namespaces(7)</a>).  Thus, since Linux 2.6.25,
              <i>/proc/net</i> is a symbolic link to the directory
              <i>/proc/self/net</i>, which contains the same files and
              directories as listed below.  However, these files and
              directories now expose information for the network
              namespace of which the process is a member.

       <i>/proc/net/arp</i>
              This holds an ASCII readable dump of the kernel ARP table
              used for address resolutions.  It will show both
              dynamically learned and preprogrammed ARP entries.  The
              format is:

                  IP address     HW type   Flags     HW address          Mask   Device
                  192.168.0.50   0x1       0x2       00:50:BF:25:68:F3   *      eth0
                  192.168.0.250  0x1       0xc       00:00:00:00:00:00   *      eth0

              Here "IP address" is the IPv4 address of the machine and
              the "HW type" is the hardware type of the address from
              RFC 826.  The flags are the internal flags of the ARP
              structure (as defined in <i>/usr/include/linux/if_arp.h</i>) and
              the "HW address" is the data link layer mapping for that
              IP address if it is known.

       <i>/proc/net/dev</i>
              The dev pseudo-file contains network device status
              information.  This gives the number of received and sent
              packets, the number of errors and collisions and other
              basic statistics.  These are used by the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ifconfig.8.html>ifconfig(8)</a>
              program to report device status.  The format is:

              is not configured into the kernel, this file will not be
              present.

       <i>/proc/net/raw</i>
              Holds a dump of the RAW socket table.  Much of the
              information is not of use apart from debugging.  The "sl"
              value is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the
              "local_address" is the local address and protocol number
              pair.  "St" is the internal status of the socket.  The
              "tx_queue" and "rx_queue" are the outgoing and incoming
              data queue in terms of kernel memory usage.  The "tr",
              "tm-&gt;when", and "rexmits" fields are not used by RAW.  The
              "uid" field holds the effective UID of the creator of the
              socket.

       <i>/proc/net/snmp</i>
              This file holds the ASCII data needed for the IP, ICMP,
              TCP, and UDP management information bases for an SNMP
              agent.

       <i>/proc/net/tcp</i>
              Holds a dump of the TCP socket table.  Much of the
              information is not of use apart from debugging.  The "sl"
              value is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the
              "local_address" is the local address and port number pair.
              The "rem_address" is the remote address and port number
              pair (if connected).  "St" is the internal status of the
              socket.  The "tx_queue" and "rx_queue" are the outgoing
              and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory usage.
              The "tr", "tm-&gt;when", and "rexmits" fields hold internal
              information of the kernel socket state and are useful only
              for debugging.  The "uid" field holds the effective UID of
              the creator of the socket.

       <i>/proc/net/udp</i>
              Holds a dump of the UDP socket table.  Much of the
              information is not of use apart from debugging.  The "sl"
              value is the kernel hash slot for the socket, the
              "local_address" is the local address and port number pair.
              The "rem_address" is the remote address and port number
              pair (if connected).  "St" is the internal status of the
              socket.  The "tx_queue" and "rx_queue" are the outgoing
              and incoming data queue in terms of kernel memory usage.
              The "tr", "tm-&gt;when", and "rexmits" fields are not used by
              UDP.  The "uid" field holds the effective UID of the
              creator of the socket.  The format is:

                     the number of users of the socket.

              <i>Protocol</i>:
                     currently always 0.

              <i>Flags</i>: the internal kernel flags holding the status of the
                     socket.

              <i>Type</i>:  the socket type.  For <b>SOCK_STREAM </b>sockets, this is
                     0001; for <b>SOCK_DGRAM </b>sockets, it is 0002; and for
                     <b>SOCK_SEQPACKET </b>sockets, it is 0005.

              <i>St</i>:    the internal state of the socket.

              <i>Inode</i>: the inode number of the socket.

              <i>Path</i>:  the bound pathname (if any) of the socket.  Sockets
                     in the abstract namespace are included in the list,
                     and are shown with a <i>Path</i> that commences with the
                     character '@'.

       <i>/proc/net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue</i>
              This file contains information about netfilter user-space
              queueing, if used.  Each line represents a queue.  Queues
              that have not been subscribed to by user space are not
              shown.

                     1   4207     0  2 65535     0     0        0  1
                    (1)   (2)    (3)(4)  (5)    (6)   (7)      (8)

              The fields in each line are:

              (1)  The ID of the queue.  This matches what is specified
                   in the <b>--queue-num </b>or <b>--queue-balance </b>options to the
                   <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/iptables.8.html>iptables(8)</a> NFQUEUE target.  See
                   <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/iptables-extensions.8.html>iptables-extensions(8)</a> for more information.

              (2)  The netlink port ID subscribed to the queue.

              (3)  The number of packets currently queued and waiting to
                   be processed by the application.

              (4)  The copy mode of the queue.  It is either 1 (metadata
                   only) or 2 (also copy payload data to user space).

              (5)  Copy range; that is, how many bytes of packet payload
                   should be copied to user space at most.

              (6)  queue dropped.  Number of packets that had to be
                   dropped by the kernel because too many packets are
                   already waiting for user space to send back the
                   mandatory accept/drop verdicts.

              (7)  queue user dropped.  Number of packets that were
                   dropped within the netlink subsystem.  Such drops
                   usually happen when the corresponding socket buffer
                   is full; that is, user space is not able to read
                   messages fast enough.

              (8)  sequence number.  Every queued packet is associated
                   with a (32-bit) monotonically increasing sequence
                   number.  This shows the ID of the most recent packet
                   queued.

              The last number exists only for compatibility reasons and
              is always 1.

       <i>/proc/partitions</i>
              Contains the major and minor numbers of each partition as
              well as the number of 1024-byte blocks and the partition
              name.

       <i>/proc/pci</i>
              This is a listing of all PCI devices found during kernel
              initialization and their configuration.

              This file has been deprecated in favor of a new <i>/proc</i>
              interface for PCI (<i>/proc/bus/pci</i>).  It became optional in
              Linux 2.2 (available with <b>CONFIG_PCI_OLD_PROC </b>set at
              kernel compilation).  It became once more nonoptionally
              enabled in Linux 2.4.  Next, it was deprecated in Linux
              2.6 (still available with <b>CONFIG_PCI_LEGACY_PROC </b>set), and
              finally removed altogether since Linux 2.6.17.

       <i>/proc/profile</i> (since Linux 2.4)
              This file is present only if the kernel was booted with
              the <i>profile=1</i> command-line option.  It exposes kernel
              profiling information in a binary format for use by
              <b>readprofile</b>(1).  Writing (e.g., an empty string) to this
              file resets the profiling counters; on some architectures,
              writing a binary integer "profiling multiplier" of size
              <i>sizeof(int)</i> sets the profiling interrupt frequency.

       <i>/proc/scsi</i>
              A directory with the <i>scsi</i> mid-level pseudo-file and
              various SCSI low-level driver directories, which contain a
              file for each SCSI host in this system, all of which give
              the status of some part of the SCSI IO subsystem.  These
              files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore,
              readable with <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html>cat(1)</a>.

              You can also write to some of the files to reconfigure the
              subsystem or switch certain features on or off.

       <i>/proc/scsi/scsi</i>
              This is a listing of all SCSI devices known to the kernel.
              The listing is similar to the one seen during bootup.
              scsi currently supports only the <i>add-single-device</i> command
              which allows root to add a hotplugged device to the list
              of known devices.

              The command

                  echo 'scsi add-single-device 1 0 5 0' &gt; /proc/scsi/scsi

              will cause host scsi1 to scan on SCSI channel 0 for a
              device on ID 5 LUN 0.  If there is already a device known
              on this address or the address is invalid, an error will
              be returned.

       <i>/proc/scsi/</i>drivername
              <i>drivername</i> can currently be NCR53c7xx, aha152x, aha1542,
              aha1740, aic7xxx, buslogic, eata_dma, eata_pio, fdomain,
              in2000, pas16, qlogic, scsi_debug, seagate, t128, u15-24f,
              ultrastore, or wd7000.  These directories show up for all
              drivers that registered at least one SCSI HBA.  Every
              directory contains one file per registered host.  Every
              host-file is named after the number the host was assigned
              during initialization.

              Reading these files will usually show driver and host
              configuration, statistics, and so on.

              Writing to these files allows different things on
              different hosts.  For example, with the <i>latency</i> and
              <i>nolatency</i> commands, root can switch on and off command
              latency measurement code in the eata_dma driver.  With the
              <i>lockup</i> and <i>unlock</i> commands, root can control bus lockups
              simulated by the scsi_debug driver.

       <i>/proc/self</i>
              This directory refers to the process accessing the <i>/proc</i>
              filesystem, and is identical to the <i>/proc</i> directory named
              by the process ID of the same process.

       <i>/proc/slabinfo</i>
              Information about kernel caches.  See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/slabinfo.5.html>slabinfo(5)</a> for
              details.

       <i>/proc/stat</i>
              kernel/system statistics.  Varies with architecture.
              Common entries include:

              <i>cpu 10132153 290696 3084719 46828483 16683 0 25195 0</i>
              <i>175628 0</i>
              <i>cpu0 1393280 32966 572056 13343292 6130 0 17875 0 23933 0</i>
                     The amount of time, measured in units of USER_HZ
                     (1/100ths of a second on most architectures, use
                     <i>sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK)</i> to obtain the right value),
                     that the system ("cpu" line) or the specific CPU
                     ("cpu<i>N</i>" line) spent in various states:

                     <i>user</i>   (1) Time spent in user mode.

                     <i>nice</i>   (2) Time spent in user mode with low
                            priority (nice).

                     <i>system</i> (3) Time spent in system mode.

                     <i>idle</i>   (4) Time spent in the idle task.  This value
                            should be USER_HZ times the second entry in
                            the <i>/proc/uptime</i> pseudo-file.

                     <i>iowait</i> (since Linux 2.5.41)
                            (5) Time waiting for I/O to complete.  This
                            value is not reliable, for the following
                            reasons:

                            •  The CPU will not wait for I/O to
                               complete; iowait is the time that a task
                               is waiting for I/O to complete.  When a
                               CPU goes into idle state for outstanding
                               task I/O, another task will be scheduled
                               on this CPU.

                            •  On a multi-core CPU, the task waiting for
                               I/O to complete is not running on any
                               CPU, so the iowait of each CPU is
                               difficult to calculate.

                            •  The value in this field may <i>decrease</i> in
                               certain conditions.

                     <i>irq</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
                            (6) Time servicing interrupts.

                     <i>softirq</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
                            (7) Time servicing softirqs.

                            (8) Stolen time, which is the time spent in
                            other operating systems when running in a
                            virtualized environment

                     <i>guest</i> (since Linux 2.6.24)
                            (9) Time spent running a virtual CPU for
                            guest operating systems under the control of
                            the Linux kernel.

                     <i>guest_nice</i> (since Linux 2.6.33)
                            (10) Time spent running a niced guest
                            (virtual CPU for guest operating systems
                            under the control of the Linux kernel).

              •  <i>nr_dentry</i> is the number of allocated dentries (dcache
                 entries).  This field is unused in Linux 2.2.

              •  <i>nr_unused</i> is the number of unused dentries.

              •  <i>age_limit</i> is the age in seconds after which dcache
                 entries can be reclaimed when memory is short.

              •  <i>want_pages</i> is nonzero when the kernel has called
                 shrink_dcache_pages() and the dcache isn't pruned yet.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/dir-notify-enable</i>
              This file can be used to disable or enable the <i>dnotify</i>
              interface described in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html>fcntl(2)</a> on a system-wide basis.  A
              value of 0 in this file disables the interface, and a
              value of 1 enables it.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-max</i>
              This file shows the maximum number of cached disk quota
              entries.  On some (2.4) systems, it is not present.  If
              the number of free cached disk quota entries is very low
              and you have some awesome number of simultaneous system
              users, you might want to raise the limit.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/dquot-nr</i>
              This file shows the number of allocated disk quota entries
              and the number of free disk quota entries.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/epoll</i> (since Linux 2.6.28)
              This directory contains the file <i>max_user_watches</i>, which
              can be used to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed
              by the <i>epoll</i> interface.  For further details, see
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html>epoll(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</i>
              This file defines a system-wide limit on the number of
              open files for all processes.  System calls that fail when
              encountering this limit fail with the error <b>ENFILE</b>.  (See
              also <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setrlimit.2.html>setrlimit(2)</a>, which can be used by a process to set
              the per-process limit, <b>RLIMIT_NOFILE</b>, on the number of
              files it may open.)  If you get lots of error messages in
              the kernel log about running out of file handles (open
              file descriptions) (look for "VFS: file-max limit &lt;number&gt;
              reached"), try increasing this value:

                  echo 100000 &gt; /proc/sys/fs/file-max

              Privileged processes (<b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>) can override the
              <i>file-max</i> limit.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/file-nr</i>
              This (read-only) file contains three numbers: the number
              of allocated file handles (i.e., the number of open file
              descriptions; see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html>open(2)</a>); the number of free file
              handles; and the maximum number of file handles (i.e., the
              same value as <i>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</i>).  If the number of
              allocated file handles is close to the maximum, you should
              consider increasing the maximum.  Before Linux 2.6, the
              kernel allocated file handles dynamically, but it didn't
              free them again.  Instead the free file handles were kept
              in a list for reallocation; the "free file handles" value
              indicates the size of that list.  A large number of free
              file handles indicates that there was a past peak in the
              usage of open file handles.  Since Linux 2.6, the kernel
              does deallocate freed file handles, and the "free file
              handles" value is always zero.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/inode-max</i> (only present until Linux 2.2)
              This file contains the maximum number of in-memory inodes.
              This value should be 3–4 times larger than the value in
              <i>file-max</i>, since <i>stdin</i>, <i>stdout</i> and network sockets also
              need an inode to handle them.  When you regularly run out
              of inodes, you need to increase this value.

              Starting with Linux 2.4, there is no longer a static limit
              on the number of inodes, and this file is removed.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/inode-nr</i>
              This file contains the first two values from <i>inode-state</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/inode-state</i>
              This file contains seven numbers: <i>nr_inodes</i>,
              <i>nr_free_inodes</i>, <i>preshrink</i>, and four dummy values (always
              zero).

              <i>nr_inodes</i> is the number of inodes the system has
              allocated.  <i>nr_free_inodes</i> represents the number of free
              inodes.

              <i>preshrink</i> is nonzero when the <i>nr_inodes</i> &gt; <i>inode-max</i> and
              the system needs to prune the inode list instead of
              allocating more; since Linux 2.4, this field is a dummy
              value (always zero).

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/inotify</i> (since Linux 2.6.13)
              This directory contains files <i>max_queued_events</i>,
              <i>max_user_instances</i>, and <i>max_user_watches</i>, that can be used
              to limit the amount of kernel memory consumed by the
              <i>inotify</i> interface.  For further details, see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inotify.7.html>inotify(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/lease-break-time</i>
              This file specifies the grace period that the kernel
              grants to a process holding a file lease (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html>fcntl(2)</a>) after
              it has sent a signal to that process notifying it that
              another process is waiting to open the file.  If the lease
              holder does not remove or downgrade the lease within this
              grace period, the kernel forcibly breaks the lease.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/leases-enable</i>
              This file can be used to enable or disable file leases
              (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fcntl.2.html>fcntl(2)</a>) on a system-wide basis.  If this file contains
              the value 0, leases are disabled.  A nonzero value enables
              leases.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/mount-max</i> (since Linux 4.9)
              The value in this file specifies the maximum number of
              mounts that may exist in a mount namespace.  The default
              value in this file is 100,000.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/mqueue</i> (since Linux 2.6.6)
              This directory contains files <i>msg_max</i>, <i>msgsize_max</i>, and
              <i>queues_max</i>, controlling the resources used by POSIX
              message queues.  See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mq_overview.7.html>mq_overview(7)</a> for details.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/nr_open</i> (since Linux 2.6.25)
              This file imposes a ceiling on the value to which the
              <b>RLIMIT_NOFILE </b>resource limit can be raised (see
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html>getrlimit(2)</a>).  This ceiling is enforced for both
              unprivileged and privileged process.  The default value in
              this file is 1048576.  (Before Linux 2.6.25, the ceiling
              for <b>RLIMIT_NOFILE </b>was hard-coded to the same value.)

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid</i> and <i>/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid</i>
              These files allow you to change the value of the fixed UID
              and GID.  The default is 65534.  Some filesystems support
              only 16-bit UIDs and GIDs, although in Linux UIDs and GIDs
              are 32 bits.  When one of these filesystems is mounted
              with writes enabled, any UID or GID that would exceed
              65535 is translated to the overflow value before being
              written to disk.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-max-size</i> (since Linux 2.6.35)
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pipe.7.html>pipe(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-hard</i> (since Linux 4.5)
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pipe.7.html>pipe(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/pipe-user-pages-soft</i> (since Linux 4.5)
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pipe.7.html>pipe(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/protected_fifos</i> (since Linux 4.19)
              The value in this file is/can be set to one of the
              following:

              0   Writing to FIFOs is unrestricted.

              1   Don't allow <b>O_CREAT open</b>(2) on FIFOs that the caller
                  doesn't own in world-writable sticky directories,
                  unless the FIFO is owned by the owner of the
                  directory.

              2   As for the value 1, but the restriction also applies
                  to group-writable sticky directories.

              The intent of the above protections is to avoid
              unintentional writes to an attacker-controlled FIFO when a
              program expected to create a regular file.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/protected_hardlinks</i> (since Linux 3.6)
              When the value in this file is 0, no restrictions are
              placed on the creation of hard links (i.e., this is the
              historical behavior before Linux 3.6).  When the value in
              this file is 1, a hard link can be created to a target
              file only if one of the following conditions is true:

              •  The calling process has the <b>CAP_FOWNER </b>capability in
                 its user namespace and the file UID has a mapping in
                 the namespace.

              •  The filesystem UID of the process creating the link
                 matches the owner (UID) of the target file (as
                 described in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/credentials.7.html>credentials(7)</a>, a process's filesystem UID
                 is normally the same as its effective UID).

              •  All of the following conditions are true:

                  •  the target is a regular file;

                  •  the target file does not have its set-user-ID mode
                     bit enabled;

                  •  the target file does not have both its set-group-ID
                     and group-executable mode bits enabled; and

                  •  the caller has permission to read and write the
                     target file (either via the file's permissions mask
                     or because it has suitable capabilities).

              The default value in this file is 0.  Setting the value to
              1 prevents a longstanding class of security issues caused
              by hard-link-based time-of-check, time-of-use races, most
              commonly seen in world-writable directories such as <i>/tmp</i>.
              The common method of exploiting this flaw is to cross
              privilege boundaries when following a given hard link
              (i.e., a root process follows a hard link created by
              another user).  Additionally, on systems without separated
              partitions, this stops unauthorized users from "pinning"
              vulnerable set-user-ID and set-group-ID files against
              being upgraded by the administrator, or linking to special
              files.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/protected_regular</i> (since Linux 4.19)
              The value in this file is/can be set to one of the
              following:

              0   Writing to regular files is unrestricted.

              1   Don't allow <b>O_CREAT open</b>(2) on regular files that the
                  caller doesn't own in world-writable sticky
                  directories, unless the regular file is owned by the
                  owner of the directory.

              2   As for the value 1, but the restriction also applies
                  to group-writable sticky directories.

              The intent of the above protections is similar to
              <i>protected_fifos</i>, but allows an application to avoid writes
              to an attacker-controlled regular file, where the
              application expected to create one.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks</i> (since Linux 3.6)
              When the value in this file is 0, no restrictions are
              placed on following symbolic links (i.e., this is the
              historical behavior before Linux 3.6).  When the value in
              this file is 1, symbolic links are followed only in the
              following circumstances:

              •  the filesystem UID of the process following the link
                 matches the owner (UID) of the symbolic link (as
                 described in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/credentials.7.html>credentials(7)</a>, a process's filesystem UID
                 is normally the same as its effective UID);

              •  the link is not in a sticky world-writable directory;
                 or

              •  the symbolic link and its parent directory have the
                 same owner (UID)

              A system call that fails to follow a symbolic link because
              of the above restrictions returns the error <b>EACCES </b>in
              <i><a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html>errno</a></i>.

              The default value in this file is 0.  Setting the value to
              1 avoids a longstanding class of security issues based on
              time-of-check, time-of-use races when accessing symbolic
              links.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> (since Linux 2.6.13)
              The value in this file is assigned to a process's
              "dumpable" flag in the circumstances described in
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a>.  In effect, the value in this file determines
              whether core dump files are produced for set-user-ID or
              otherwise protected/tainted binaries.  The "dumpable"
              setting also affects the ownership of files in a process's
              <i>/proc/</i>pid directory, as described above.

              Three different integer values can be specified:

              <i>0 (default)</i>
                     This provides the traditional (pre-Linux 2.6.13)
                     behavior.  A core dump will not be produced for a
                     process which has changed credentials (by calling
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seteuid.2.html>seteuid(2)</a>, <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgid.2.html>setgid(2)</a>, or similar, or by executing
                     a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program) or whose
                     binary does not have read permission enabled.

              <i>1 ("debug")</i>
                     All processes dump core when possible.  (Reasons
                     why a process might nevertheless not dump core are
                     described in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html>core(5)</a>.)  The core dump is owned by
                     the filesystem user ID of the dumping process and
                     no security is applied.  This is intended for
                     system debugging situations only: this mode is
                     insecure because it allows unprivileged users to
                     examine the memory contents of privileged
                     processes.

              <i>2 ("suidsafe")</i>
                     Any binary which normally would not be dumped (see
                     "0" above) is dumped readable by root only.  This
                     allows the user to remove the core dump file but
                     not to read it.  For security reasons core dumps in
                     this mode will not overwrite one another or other
                     files.  This mode is appropriate when
                     administrators are attempting to debug problems in
                     a normal environment.

                     Additionally, since Linux 3.6,
                     <i>/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern</i> must either be an
                     absolute pathname or a pipe command, as detailed in
                     <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/core.5.html>core(5)</a>.  Warnings will be written to the kernel
                     log if <i>core_pattern</i> does not follow these rules,
                     and no core dump will be produced.

              For details of the effect of a process's "dumpable"
              setting on ptrace access mode checking, see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html>ptrace(2)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/super-max</i>
              This file controls the maximum number of superblocks, and
              thus the maximum number of mounted filesystems the kernel
              can have.  You need increase only <i>super-max</i> if you need to
              mount more filesystems than the current value in <i>super-max</i>
              allows you to.

       <i>/proc/sys/fs/super-nr</i>
              This file contains the number of filesystems currently
              mounted.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel</i>
              This directory contains files controlling a range of
              kernel parameters, as described below.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/acct</i>
              This file contains three numbers: <i>highwater</i>, <i>lowwater</i>, and
              <i>frequency</i>.  If BSD-style process accounting is enabled,
              these values control its behavior.  If free space on
              filesystem where the log lives goes below <i>lowwater</i>
              percent, accounting suspends.  If free space gets above
              <i>highwater</i> percent, accounting resumes.  <i>frequency</i>
              determines how often the kernel checks the amount of free
              space (value is in seconds).  Default values are 4, 2, and
              30.  That is, suspend accounting if 2% or less space is
              free; resume it if 4% or more space is free; consider
              information about amount of free space valid for 30
              seconds.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni</i> (Linux 2.6.27 to Linux 3.18)
              From Linux 2.6.27 to Linux 3.18, this file was used to
              control recomputing of the value in
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni</i> upon the addition or removal of
              memory or upon IPC namespace creation/removal.  Echoing
              "1" into this file enabled <i>msgmni</i> automatic recomputing
              (and triggered a recomputation of <i>msgmni</i> based on the
              current amount of available memory and number of IPC
              namespaces).  Echoing "0" disabled automatic recomputing.
              (Automatic recomputing was also disabled if a value was
              explicitly assigned to <i>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni</i>.)  The
              default value in <i>auto_msgmni</i> was 1.

              Since Linux 3.19, the content of this file has no effect
              (because <i>msgmni</i> defaults to near the maximum value
              possible), and reads from this file always return the
              value "0".

              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html>capabilities(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i> (from Linux 2.2 to Linux 2.6.24)
              This file holds the value of the kernel <i>capability</i>
              <i>bounding set</i> (expressed as a signed decimal number).  This
              set is ANDed against the capabilities permitted to a
              process during <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html>execve(2)</a>.  Starting with Linux 2.6.25, the
              system-wide capability bounding set disappeared, and was
              replaced by a per-thread bounding set; see
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html>capabilities(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/ctrl-alt-del</i>
              This file controls the handling of Ctrl-Alt-Del from the
              keyboard.  When the value in this file is 0, Ctrl-Alt-Del
              is trapped and sent to the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/init.1.html>init(1)</a> program to handle a
              graceful restart.  When the value is greater than zero,
              Linux's reaction to a Vulcan Nerve Pinch (tm) will be an
              immediate reboot, without even syncing its dirty buffers.
              Note: when a program (like dosemu) has the keyboard in
              "raw" mode, the Ctrl-Alt-Del is intercepted by the program
              before it ever reaches the kernel tty layer, and it's up
              to the program to decide what to do with it.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/dmesg_restrict</i> (since Linux 2.6.37)
              The value in this file determines who can see kernel
              syslog contents.  A value of 0 in this file imposes no
              restrictions.  If the value is 1, only privileged users
              can read the kernel syslog.  (See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syslog.2.html>syslog(2)</a> for more
              details.)  Since Linux 3.4, only users with the
              <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability may change the value in this
              file.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/domainname</i> and <i>/proc/sys/kernel/hostname</i>
              can be used to set the NIS/YP domainname and the hostname
              of your box in exactly the same way as the commands
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/domainname.1.html>domainname(1)</a> and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/hostname.1.html>hostname(1)</a>, that is:

                  # <b>echo 'darkstar' &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/hostname</b>
                  # <b>echo 'mydomain' &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/domainname</b>

              has the same effect as

                  # <b>hostname 'darkstar'</b>
                  # <b>domainname 'mydomain'</b>

              Note, however, that the classic darkstar.frop.org has the
              hostname "darkstar" and DNS (Internet Domain Name Server)
              domainname "frop.org", not to be confused with the NIS
              (Network Information Service) or YP (Yellow Pages)
              domainname.  These two domain names are in general
              different.  For a detailed discussion see the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/hostname.1.html>hostname(1)</a>
              man page.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug</i>
              This file contains the pathname for the hotplug policy
              agent.  The default value in this file is <i>/sbin/hotplug</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/htab-reclaim</i> (before Linux 2.4.9.2)
              (PowerPC only) If this file is set to a nonzero value, the
              PowerPC htab (see kernel file
              <i>Documentation/powerpc/ppc_htab.txt</i>) is pruned each time
              the system hits the idle loop.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/keys/*</i>
              This directory contains various files that define
              parameters and limits for the key-management facility.
              These files are described in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyrings.7.html>keyrings(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict</i> (since Linux 2.6.38)
              The value in this file determines whether kernel addresses
              are exposed via <i>/proc</i> files and other interfaces.  A value
              of 0 in this file imposes no restrictions.  If the value
              is 1, kernel pointers printed using the <i>%pK</i> format
              specifier will be replaced with zeros unless the user has
              the <b>CAP_SYSLOG </b>capability.  If the value is 2, kernel
              pointers printed using the <i>%pK</i> format specifier will be
              replaced with zeros regardless of the user's capabilities.
              The initial default value for this file was 1, but the
              default was changed to 0 in Linux 2.6.39.  Since Linux
              3.4, only users with the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN </b>capability can
              change the value in this file.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/l2cr</i>
              (PowerPC only) This file contains a flag that controls the
              L2 cache of G3 processor boards.  If 0, the cache is
              disabled.  Enabled if nonzero.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/modprobe</i>
              This file contains the pathname for the kernel module
              loader.  The default value is <i>/sbin/modprobe</i>.  The file is
              present only if the kernel is built with the
              <b>CONFIG_MODULES </b>(<b>CONFIG_KMOD </b>in Linux 2.6.26 and earlier)
              option enabled.  It is described by the Linux kernel
              source file <i>Documentation/kmod.txt</i> (present only in Linux
              2.4 and earlier).

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/modules_disabled</i> (since Linux 2.6.31)
              A toggle value indicating if modules are allowed to be
              loaded in an otherwise modular kernel.  This toggle
              defaults to off (0), but can be set true (1).  Once true,
              modules can be neither loaded nor unloaded, and the toggle
              cannot be set back to false.  The file is present only if
              the kernel is built with the <b>CONFIG_MODULES </b>option
              enabled.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmax</i> (since Linux 2.2)
              This file defines a system-wide limit specifying the
              maximum number of bytes in a single message written on a
              System V message queue.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmni</i> (since Linux 2.4)
              This file defines the system-wide limit on the number of
              message queue identifiers.  See also
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/auto_msgmni</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb</i> (since Linux 2.2)
              This file defines a system-wide parameter used to
              initialize the <i>msg_qbytes</i> setting for subsequently created
              message queues.  The <i>msg_qbytes</i> setting specifies the
              maximum number of bytes that may be written to the message
              queue.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max</i> (since Linux 2.6.4)
              This is a read-only file that displays the upper limit on
              the number of a process's group memberships.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid</i> (since Linux 3.3)
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html>pid_namespaces(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/ostype</i> and <i>/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease</i>
              These files give substrings of <i>/proc/version</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid</i> and <i>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid</i>
              These files duplicate the files <i>/proc/sys/fs/overflowgid</i>
              and <i>/proc/sys/fs/overflowuid</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/panic</i>
              This file gives read/write access to the kernel variable
              <i>panic_timeout</i>.  If this is zero, the kernel will loop on a
              panic; if nonzero, it indicates that the kernel should
              autoreboot after this number of seconds.  When you use the
              software watchdog device driver, the recommended setting
              is 60.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops</i> (since Linux 2.5.68)
              This file controls the kernel's behavior when an oops or
              BUG is encountered.  If this file contains 0, then the
              system tries to continue operation.  If it contains 1,
              then the system delays a few seconds (to give klogd time
              to record the oops output) and then panics.  If the
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/panic</i> file is also nonzero, then the
              machine will be rebooted.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max</i> (since Linux 2.5.34)
              This file specifies the value at which PIDs wrap around
              (i.e., the value in this file is one greater than the
              maximum PID).  PIDs greater than this value are not
              allocated; thus, the value in this file also acts as a
              system-wide limit on the total number of processes and
              threads.  The default value for this file, 32768, results
              in the same range of PIDs as on earlier kernels.  On
              32-bit platforms, 32768 is the maximum value for <i>pid_max</i>.
              On 64-bit systems, <i>pid_max</i> can be set to any value up to
              2^22 (<b>PID_MAX_LIMIT</b>, approximately 4 million).

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/powersave-nap</i> (PowerPC only)
              This file contains a flag.  If set, Linux-PPC will use the
              "nap" mode of powersaving, otherwise the "doze" mode will
              be used.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/printk</i>
              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syslog.2.html>syslog(2)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/pty</i> (since Linux 2.6.4)
              This directory contains two files relating to the number
              of UNIX 98 pseudoterminals (see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/pts.4.html>pts(4)</a>) on the system.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/max</i>
              This file defines the maximum number of pseudoterminals.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/pty/nr</i>
              This read-only file indicates how many pseudoterminals are
              currently in use.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/random</i>
              This directory contains various parameters controlling the
              operation of the file <i>/dev/random</i>.  See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/random.4.html>random(4)</a> for
              further information.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid</i> (since Linux 2.4)
              Each read from this read-only file returns a randomly
              generated 128-bit UUID, as a string in the standard UUID
              format.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space</i> (since Linux 2.6.12)
              Select the address space layout randomization (ASLR)
              policy for the system (on architectures that support
              ASLR).  Three values are supported for this file:

              <b>0      </b>Turn ASLR off.  This is the default for
                     architectures that don't support ASLR, and when the
                     kernel is booted with the <i>norandmaps</i> parameter.

              <b>1      </b>Make the addresses of <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>mmap(2)</a> allocations, the
                     stack, and the VDSO page randomized.  Among other
                     things, this means that shared libraries will be
                     loaded at randomized addresses.  The text segment
                     of PIE-linked binaries will also be loaded at a
                     randomized address.  This value is the default if
                     the kernel was configured with <b>CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK</b>.

              <b>2      </b>(Since Linux 2.6.25) Also support heap
                     randomization.  This value is the default if the
                     kernel was not configured with <b>CONFIG_COMPAT_BRK</b>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/real-root-dev</i>
              This file is documented in the Linux kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/admin-guide/initrd.rst</i> (or
              <i>Documentation/initrd.txt</i> before Linux 4.10).

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/reboot-cmd</i> (Sparc only)
              This file seems to be a way to give an argument to the
              SPARC ROM/Flash boot loader.  Maybe to tell it what to do
              after rebooting?

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-max</i>
              (Up to and including Linux 2.6.7; see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setrlimit.2.html>setrlimit(2)</a>) This
              file can be used to tune the maximum number of POSIX real-
              time (queued) signals that can be outstanding in the
              system.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/rtsig-nr</i>
              (Up to and including Linux 2.6.7.)  This file shows the
              number of POSIX real-time signals currently queued.

              See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sched.7.html>sched(7)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first</i> (since Linux 2.6.23)
              If this file contains the value zero, then, after a
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html>fork(2)</a>, the parent is first scheduled on the CPU.  If the
              file contains a nonzero value, then the child is scheduled
              first on the CPU.  (Of course, on a multiprocessor system,
              the parent and the child might both immediately be
              scheduled on a CPU.)

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/seccomp</i> (since Linux 4.14)
              This directory provides additional seccomp information and
              configuration.  See <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html>seccomp(2)</a> for further details.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/sem</i> (since Linux 2.4)
              This file contains 4 numbers defining limits for System V
              IPC semaphores.  These fields are, in order:

              SEMMSL The maximum semaphores per semaphore set.

              SEMMNS A system-wide limit on the number of semaphores in
                     all semaphore sets.

              SEMOPM The maximum number of operations that may be
                     specified in a <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/semop.2.html>semop(2)</a> call.

              SEMMNI A system-wide limit on the maximum number of
                     semaphore identifiers.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/sg-big-buff</i>
              This file shows the size of the generic SCSI device (sg)
              buffer.  You can't tune it just yet, but you could change
              it at compile time by editing <i>include/scsi/sg.h</i> and
              changing the value of <b>SG_BIG_BUFF</b>.  However, there
              shouldn't be any reason to change this value.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/shm_rmid_forced</i> (since Linux 3.1)
              If this file is set to 1, all System V shared memory
              segments will be marked for destruction as soon as the
              number of attached processes falls to zero; in other
              words, it is no longer possible to create shared memory
              segments that exist independently of any attached process.

              The effect is as though a <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmctl.2.html>shmctl(2)</a> <b>IPC_RMID </b>is performed
              on all existing segments as well as all segments created
              in the future (until this file is reset to 0).  Note that
              existing segments that are attached to no process will be
              immediately destroyed when this file is set to 1.  Setting
              this option will also destroy segments that were created,
              but never attached, upon termination of the process that
              created the segment with <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmget.2.html>shmget(2)</a>.

              Setting this file to 1 provides a way of ensuring that all
              System V shared memory segments are counted against the
              resource usage and resource limits (see the description of
              <b>RLIMIT_AS </b>in <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html>getrlimit(2)</a>) of at least one process.

              Because setting this file to 1 produces behavior that is
              nonstandard and could also break existing applications,
              the default value in this file is 0.  Set this file to 1
              only if you have a good understanding of the semantics of
              the applications using System V shared memory on your
              system.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/shmall</i> (since Linux 2.2)
              This file contains the system-wide limit on the total
              number of pages of System V shared memory.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax</i> (since Linux 2.2)
              This file can be used to query and set the run-time limit
              on the maximum (System V IPC) shared memory segment size
              that can be created.  Shared memory segments up to 1 GB
              are now supported in the kernel.  This value defaults to
              <b>SHMMAX</b>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni</i> (since Linux 2.4)
              This file specifies the system-wide maximum number of
              System V shared memory segments that can be created.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/sysctl_writes_strict</i> (since Linux 3.16)
              The value in this file determines how the file offset
              affects the behavior of updating entries in files under
              <i>/proc/sys</i>.  The file has three possible values:

              -1  This provides legacy handling, with no printk
                  warnings.  Each <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html>write(2)</a> must fully contain the value
                  to be written, and multiple writes on the same file
                  descriptor will overwrite the entire value, regardless
                  of the file position.

              0   (default) This provides the same behavior as for -1,
                  but printk warnings are written for processes that
                  perform writes when the file offset is not 0.

              1   Respect the file offset when writing strings into
                  <i>/proc/sys</i> files.  Multiple writes will <i>append</i> to the
                  value buffer.  Anything written beyond the maximum
                  length of the value buffer will be ignored.  Writes to
                  numeric <i>/proc/sys</i> entries must always be at file
                  offset 0 and the value must be fully contained in the
                  buffer provided to <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html>write(2)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</i>
              This file controls the functions allowed to be invoked by
              the SysRq key.  By default, the file contains 1 meaning
              that every possible SysRq request is allowed (in older
              kernel versions, SysRq was disabled by default, and you
              were required to specifically enable it at run-time, but
              this is not the case any more).  Possible values in this
              file are:

              0    Disable sysrq completely

              1    Enable all functions of sysrq

              &gt; 1  Bit mask of allowed sysrq functions, as follows:
                     2  Enable control of console logging level
                     4  Enable control of keyboard (SAK, unraw)
                     8  Enable debugging dumps of processes etc.
                    16  Enable sync command
                    32  Enable remount read-only
                    64  Enable signaling of processes (term, kill, oom-
                        kill)
                   128  Allow reboot/poweroff
                   256  Allow nicing of all real-time tasks

              This file is present only if the <b>CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ </b>kernel
              configuration option is enabled.  For further details see
              the Linux kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/admin-guide/sysrq.rst</i> (or
              <i>Documentation/sysrq.txt</i> before Linux 4.10).

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/version</i>
              This file contains a string such as:

                  #5 Wed Feb 25 21:49:24 MET 1998

              The "#5" means that this is the fifth kernel built from
              this source base and the date following it indicates the
              time the kernel was built.

       <i>/proc/sys/kernel/threads-max</i> (since Linux 2.3.11)
              This file specifies the system-wide limit on the number of
              threads (tasks) that can be created on the system.

              Since Linux 4.1, the value that can be written to
              <i>threads-max</i> is bounded.  The minimum value that can be
              written is 20.  The maximum value that can be written is
              given by the constant <b>FUTEX_TID_MASK </b>(0x3fffffff).  If a
              value outside of this range is written to <i>threads-max</i>, the
              error <b>EINVAL </b>occurs.

              The value written is checked against the available RAM
              pages.  If the thread structures would occupy too much
              (more than 1/8th) of the available RAM pages, <i>threads-max</i>
              is reduced accordingly.

              present.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm</i>
              This directory contains files for memory management
              tuning, buffer, and cache management.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes</i> (since Linux 3.10)
              This file defines the amount of free memory (in KiB) on
              the system that should be reserved for users with the
              capability <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>.

              The default value in this file is the minimum of [3% of
              free pages, 8MiB] expressed as KiB.  The default is
              intended to provide enough for the superuser to log in and
              kill a process, if necessary, under the default overcommit
              'guess' mode (i.e., 0 in <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>).

              Systems running in "overcommit never" mode (i.e., 2 in
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>) should increase the value
              in this file to account for the full virtual memory size
              of the programs used to recover (e.g., <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/login.1.html>login(1)</a> <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh.1.html>ssh(1)</a>,
              and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/top.1.html>top(1)</a>) Otherwise, the superuser may not be able to
              log in to recover the system.  For example, on x86-64 a
              suitable value is 131072 (128MiB reserved).

              Changing the value in this file takes effect whenever an
              application requests memory.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/compact_memory</i> (since Linux 2.6.35)
              When 1 is written to this file, all zones are compacted
              such that free memory is available in contiguous blocks
              where possible.  The effect of this action can be seen by
              examining <i>/proc/buddyinfo</i>.

              Present only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_COMPACTION</b>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches</i> (since Linux 2.6.16)
              Writing to this file causes the kernel to drop clean
              caches, dentries, and inodes from memory, causing that
              memory to become free.  This can be useful for memory
              management testing and performing reproducible filesystem
              benchmarks.  Because writing to this file causes the
              benefits of caching to be lost, it can degrade overall
              system performance.

              To free pagecache, use:

                  echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

              To free dentries and inodes, use:

                  echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

              To free pagecache, dentries, and inodes, use:

                  echo 3 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

              Because writing to this file is a nondestructive operation
              and dirty objects are not freeable, the user should run
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sync.1.html>sync(1)</a> first.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/sysctl_hugetlb_shm_group</i> (since Linux 2.6.7)
              This writable file contains a group ID that is allowed to
              allocate memory using huge pages.  If a process has a
              filesystem group ID or any supplementary group ID that
              matches this group ID, then it can make huge-page
              allocations without holding the <b>CAP_IPC_LOCK </b>capability;
              see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html>memfd_create(2)</a>, <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>mmap(2)</a>, and <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmget.2.html>shmget(2)</a>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/legacy_va_layout</i> (since Linux 2.6.9)
              If nonzero, this disables the new 32-bit memory-mapping
              layout; the kernel will use the legacy (2.4) layout for
              all processes.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_early_kill</i> (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Control how to kill processes when an uncorrected memory
              error (typically a 2-bit error in a memory module) that
              cannot be handled by the kernel is detected in the
              background by hardware.  In some cases (like the page
              still having a valid copy on disk), the kernel will handle
              the failure transparently without affecting any
              applications.  But if there is no other up-to-date copy of
              the data, it will kill processes to prevent any data
              corruptions from propagating.

              The file has one of the following values:

              <b>1      </b>Kill all processes that have the corrupted-and-not-
                     reloadable page mapped as soon as the corruption is
                     detected.  Note that this is not supported for a
                     few types of pages, such as kernel internally
                     allocated data or the swap cache, but works for the
                     majority of user pages.

              <b>0      </b>Unmap the corrupted page from all processes and
                     kill a process only if it tries to access the page.

              The kill is performed using a <b>SIGBUS </b>signal with <i>si_code</i>
              set to <b>BUS_MCEERR_AO</b>.  Processes can handle this if they
              want to; see <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html>sigaction(2)</a> for more details.

              This feature is active only on architectures/platforms
              with advanced machine check handling and depends on the
              hardware capabilities.

              Applications can override the <i>memory_failure_early_kill</i>
              setting individually with the <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html>prctl(2)</a> <b>PR_MCE_KILL</b>
              operation.

              Present only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/memory_failure_recovery</i> (since Linux 2.6.32)
              Enable memory failure recovery (when supported by the
              platform).

              <b>1      </b>Attempt recovery.

              <b>0      </b>Always panic on a memory failure.

              Present only if the kernel was configured with
              <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/oom_dump_tasks</i> (since Linux 2.6.25)
              Enables a system-wide task dump (excluding kernel threads)
              to be produced when the kernel performs an OOM-killing.
              The dump includes the following information for each task
              (thread, process): thread ID, real user ID, thread group
              ID (process ID), virtual memory size, resident set size,
              the CPU that the task is scheduled on, oom_adj score (see
              the description of <i>/proc/</i>pid<i>/oom_adj</i>), and command name.
              This is helpful to determine why the OOM-killer was
              invoked and to identify the rogue task that caused it.

              If this contains the value zero, this information is
              suppressed.  On very large systems with thousands of
              tasks, it may not be feasible to dump the memory state
              information for each one.  Such systems should not be
              forced to incur a performance penalty in OOM situations
              when the information may not be desired.

              If this is set to nonzero, this information is shown
              whenever the OOM-killer actually kills a memory-hogging
              task.

              The default value is 0.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task</i> (since Linux 2.6.24)
              This enables or disables killing the OOM-triggering task
              in out-of-memory situations.

              If this is set to zero, the OOM-killer will scan through
              the entire tasklist and select a task based on heuristics
              to kill.  This normally selects a rogue memory-hogging
              task that frees up a large amount of memory when killed.

              If this is set to nonzero, the OOM-killer simply kills the
              task that triggered the out-of-memory condition.  This
              avoids a possibly expensive tasklist scan.

              If <i>/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom</i> is nonzero, it takes
              precedence over whatever value is used in
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task</i>.

              The default value is 0.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes</i> (since Linux 3.14)
              This writable file provides an alternative to
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</i> for controlling the
              <i>CommitLimit</i> when <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> has the
              value 2.  It allows the amount of memory overcommitting to
              be specified as an absolute value (in kB), rather than as
              a percentage, as is done with <i>overcommit_ratio</i>.  This
              allows for finer-grained control of <i>CommitLimit</i> on systems
              with extremely large memory sizes.

              Only one of <i>overcommit_kbytes</i> or <i>overcommit_ratio</i> can have
              an effect: if <i>overcommit_kbytes</i> has a nonzero value, then
              it is used to calculate <i>CommitLimit</i>, otherwise
              <i>overcommit_ratio</i> is used.  Writing a value to either of
              these files causes the value in the other file to be set
              to zero.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>
              This file contains the kernel virtual memory accounting
              mode.  Values are:

                     0: heuristic overcommit (this is the default)
                     1: always overcommit, never check
                     2: always check, never overcommit

              In mode 0, calls of <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html>mmap(2)</a> with <b>MAP_NORESERVE </b>are not
              checked, and the default check is very weak, leading to
              the risk of getting a process "OOM-killed".

              In mode 1, the kernel pretends there is always enough
              memory, until memory actually runs out.  One use case for
              this mode is scientific computing applications that employ
              large sparse arrays.  Before Linux 2.6.0, any nonzero
              value implies mode 1.

              In mode 2 (available since Linux 2.6), the total virtual
              address space that can be allocated (<i>CommitLimit</i> in
              <i>/proc/meminfo</i>) is calculated as

                  CommitLimit = (total_RAM - total_huge_TLB) *
                             overcommit_ratio / 100 + total_swap

              where:

              •  <i>total_RAM</i> is the total amount of RAM on the system;

              •  <i>total_huge_TLB</i> is the amount of memory set aside for
                 huge pages;

              •  <i>overcommit_ratio</i> is the value in
                 <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</i>; and

              •  <i>total_swap</i> is the amount of swap space.

              For example, on a system with 16 GB of physical RAM, 16 GB
              of swap, no space dedicated to huge pages, and an
              <i>overcommit_ratio</i> of 50, this formula yields a <i>CommitLimit</i>
              of 24 GB.

              Since Linux 3.14, if the value in
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes</i> is nonzero, then
              <i>CommitLimit</i> is instead calculated as:

                  CommitLimit = overcommit_kbytes + total_swap

              See also the description of
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes</i> and
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/user_reserve_kbytes</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This writable file defines a percentage by which memory
              can be overcommitted.  The default value in the file is
              50.  See the description of
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i>.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/panic_on_oom</i> (since Linux 2.6.18)
              This enables or disables a kernel panic in an out-of-
              memory situation.

              If this file is set to the value 0, the kernel's OOM-
              killer will kill some rogue process.  Usually, the OOM-
              killer is able to kill a rogue process and the system will
              survive.

              If this file is set to the value 1, then the kernel
              normally panics when out-of-memory happens.  However, if a
              process limits allocations to certain nodes using memory
              policies (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mbind.2.html>mbind(2)</a> <b>MPOL_BIND</b>) or cpusets (<a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cpuset.7.html>cpuset(7)</a>) and
              those nodes reach memory exhaustion status, one process
              may be killed by the OOM-killer.  No panic occurs in this
              case: because other nodes' memory may be free, this means
              the system as a whole may not have reached an out-of-
              memory situation yet.

              If this file is set to the value 2, the kernel always
              panics when an out-of-memory condition occurs.

              The default value is 0.  1 and 2 are for failover of
              clustering.  Select either according to your policy of
              failover.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/swappiness</i>
              The value in this file controls how aggressively the
              kernel will swap memory pages.  Higher values increase
              aggressiveness, lower values decrease aggressiveness.  The
              default value is 60.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/user_reserve_kbytes</i> (since Linux 3.10)
              Specifies an amount of memory (in KiB) to reserve for user
              processes.  This is intended to prevent a user from
              starting a single memory hogging process, such that they
              cannot recover (kill the hog).  The value in this file has
              an effect only when <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> is set
              to 2 ("overcommit never" mode).  In this case, the system
              reserves an amount of memory that is the minimum of [3% of
              current process size, <i>user_reserve_kbytes</i>].

              The default value in this file is the minimum of [3% of
              free pages, 128MiB] expressed as KiB.

              If the value in this file is set to zero, then a user will
              be allowed to allocate all free memory with a single
              process (minus the amount reserved by
              <i>/proc/sys/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes</i>).  Any subsequent
              attempts to execute a command will result in "fork: Cannot
              allocate memory".

              Changing the value in this file takes effect whenever an
              application requests memory.

       <i>/proc/sys/vm/unprivileged_userfaultfd</i> (since Linux 5.2)
              This (writable) file exposes a flag that controls whether
              unprivileged processes are allowed to employ
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html>userfaultfd(2)</a>.  If this file has the value 1, then
              unprivileged processes may use <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html>userfaultfd(2)</a>.  If this
              file has the value 0, then only processes that have the
              <b>CAP_SYS_PTRACE </b>capability may employ <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/userfaultfd.2.html>userfaultfd(2)</a>.  The
              default value in this file is 1.

       <i>/proc/sysrq-trigger</i> (since Linux 2.4.21)
              Writing a character to this file triggers the same SysRq
              function as typing ALT-SysRq-&lt;character&gt; (see the
              description of <i>/proc/sys/kernel/sysrq</i>).  This file is
              normally writable only by <i>root</i>.  For further details see
              the Linux kernel source file
              <i>Documentation/admin-guide/sysrq.rst</i> (or
              <i>Documentation/sysrq.txt</i> before Linux 4.10).

       <i>/proc/sysvipc</i>
              Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files <i>msg</i>, <i>sem</i> and <i>shm</i>.
              These files list the System V Interprocess Communication
              (IPC) objects (respectively: message queues, semaphores,
              and shared memory) that currently exist on the system,
              providing similar information to that available via
              <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ipcs.1.html>ipcs(1)</a>.  These files have headers and are formatted (one
              IPC object per line) for easy understanding.  <a href=https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/sysvipc.7.html>sysvipc(7)</a>
              provides further background on the information shown by
              these files.

       <i>/proc/thread-self</i> (since Linux 3.17)
              This directory refers to the thread accessing the <i>/proc</i>
              filesystem, and is identical to the <i>/proc/self/task/</i>tid
              directory named by the process thread ID (<i>tid</i>) of the same
              thread.

       <i>/proc/timer_list</i> (since Linux 2.6.21)
              This read-only file exposes a list of all currently
              pending (high-resolution) timers, all clock-event sources,
              and their parameters in a human-readable form.

       <i>/proc/timer_stats</i> (from  Linux 2.6.21 until Linux 4.10)
              This is a debugging facility to make timer (ab)use in a
              Linux system visible to kernel and user-space developers.
              It can be used by kernel and user-space developers to
              verify that their code does not make undue use of timers.
              The goal is to avoid unnecessary wakeups, thereby
              optimizing power consumption.

              If enabled in the kernel (<b>CONFIG_TIMER_STATS</b>), but not
              used, it has almost zero run-time overhead and a
              relatively small data-structure overhead.  Even if
              collection is enabled at run time, overhead is low: all
              the locking is per-CPU and lookup is hashed.

              The <i>/proc/timer_stats</i> file is used both to control
              sampling facility and to read out the sampled information.

              The <i>timer_stats</i> functionality is inactive on bootup.  A
              sampling period can be started using the following
              command:

                  # echo 1 &gt; /proc/timer_stats

              The following command stops a sampling period:

                  # echo 0 &gt; /proc/timer_stats

              The statistics can be retrieved by:

                  $ cat /proc/timer_stats

              While sampling is enabled, each readout from
              <i>/proc/timer_stats</i> will see newly updated statistics.  Once
              sampling is disabled, the sampled information is kept
              until a new sample period is started.  This allows
              multiple readouts.

              Sample output from <i>/proc/timer_stats</i>:

                  $ <b>cat /proc/timer_stats</b>
                  Timer Stats Version: v0.3
                  Sample period: 1.764 s

                  1029 total events, 583.333 events/sec

              The output columns are:

              [1]  a count of the number of events, optionally (since
                   Linux 2.6.23) followed by the letter 'D' if this is a
                   deferrable timer;

              [2]  the PID of the process that initialized the timer;

              [3]  the name of the process that initialized the timer;

              [4]  the function where the timer was initialized; and (in
                   parentheses) the callback function that is associated
                   with the timer.

              During the Linux 4.11 development cycle, this file  was
              removed because of security concerns, as it exposes
              information across namespaces.  Furthermore, it is
              possible to obtain the same information via in-kernel
              tracing facilities such as ftrace.

       <i>/proc/tty</i>
              Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files and
              subdirectories for tty drivers and line disciplines.

       <i>/proc/uptime</i>
              This file contains two numbers (values in seconds): the
              uptime of the system (including time spent in suspend) and
              the amount of time spent in the idle process.

       <i>/proc/version</i>
              This string identifies the kernel version that is
              currently running.  It includes the contents of
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/ostype</i>, <i>/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease</i>, and
              <i>/proc/sys/kernel/version</i>.  For example:

       <i>/proc/vmstat</i> (since Linux 2.6.0)
              This file displays various virtual memory statistics.
              Each line of this file contains a single name-value pair,
              delimited by white space.  Some lines are present only if
              the kernel was configured with suitable options.  (In some
              cases, the options required for particular files have
              changed across kernel versions, so they are not listed
              here.  Details can be found by consulting the kernel

<h2><a id=NOTES href=#NOTES></a>NOTES &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=#top_of_page><span class=top-link>top</span></a></h2><pre>       Many files contain strings (e.g., the environment and command
       line) that are in the internal format, with subfields terminated
       by null bytes ('\0').  When inspecting such files, you may find
       that the results are more readable if you use a command of the
       following form to display them:

       This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and is the
